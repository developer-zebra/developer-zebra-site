# Transaction and Schema Level

This section describes Managed Configurations that are used internally by an EMM to manage transactions that apply configurations defined by an Administrator to a Zebra Android device and/or to obtain information about the Schema that defines available configuration options.

### Transaction Steps

This Managed Configuration allows an EMM to enable an Administrator to defined a sequence of steps that perform configuration of various configurations and to organize those steps into a single transaction to be performed on a Zebra Android device.

Any number of transaction steps can be included within a transaction and the individual transactions steps will be executed in the order they appear within this Managed Configuration.

#### Transaction Step

This Managed Configuration allows an EMM to enable an Administrator to specify a single transaction step that defines one or more configurations to be performed on a Zebra Android device as part of a transaction.

Multiple configurations of different types can optionally be defined as part of a single transaction step, but an Administrator CANNOT control the order or execution of such configurations within a given step.

- The system will execute multiple configurations within the same step in an order designed to maximize the chance that all configurations can be successfully executed.

- If an Administrator needs to tightly control the order of relative execution of various configurations, they should be included into different transaction steps so their order can be controlled by ordering those steps within the transaction.

The following section **Transaction Step Level** describes the Managed Configurations that are available for an Administrator to use to define the configurations that can be perform as a part of a transaction step.

# Transaction Step Level

This section describes Managed Configurations that allow an Administrator using an EMM to define the configuration to be performed as part of a step within a transaction, to describe the step, and to define how errors that occur during the step will be handled.

## Transaction Step Explanation

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to specify optional explanatory text that describes the purpose or intended behavior of a transaction step.

Since a transaction may include multiple steps and each transaction step could include one or more configurations, describing the step can be invaluable when later reviewing the configuration defined by a transaction and/or when editing a transaction, especially when reordering the steps within a transaction.

## Transaction Step Error Mode

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to define how errors that occur during the execution of a transaction step should be handled.

Since a transaction may include multiple steps and each transaction step could include one or more configurations, there may be cases where steps within a transaction are dependent on steps earlier in the same transaction.  In such cases, it may be desirable to terminate a transaction if the processing of a step results in an error to avoid propagating the results of that error into subsequent steps.

By default, execution will continue with the next transaction step once execution of the current step is completed.

A decision to override this default behavior can be made independently for each step within a transaction by supplying an Error Mode value:

- An Error Mode value of ***Continue*** indicates that any errors that occur during the execution of the current transaction step should NOT terminate execution of subsequent steps in the same transaction.  Execution will thus always continue with the next transaction step once execution of the current step is completed.

- An Error Mode value of ***Stop*** indicates that any errors that occur during the execution of the current transaction step should terminate execution of subsequent steps in the same transaction.  Execution will continue with the next transaction step only if execution of the current step completes with NO errors.

## Analytics Configuration

This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to configure the Analytics Client in a Zebra Android device.

### Analytics Configuration - State

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to control whether the Analytics Client on a Zebra Android device is turned on (enabled) or turned off (disabled).

The Analytics Client is turned on (enabled) by default on all Zebra Android devices:

- When a value of ***Off*** is chosen, the Analytics Client will be turned off (disabled), and hence it will not collect any machine data during the operation of the device and will not deliver any machine data regardless of whether connectivity is available.

- When a value of ***On*** is chosen, the Analytics Client will be turned on (enabled), and hence it will automatically collect machine data during the operation of the device and deliver it, when connectivity is available, to the Zebra Analytics Cloud Server.

On some Zebra Android devices, the ability for an Administrator to use an EMM to turn off (disable) the Analytics Client may not be supported.

## Blacklist Configuration

This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to include configuration within a transaction step to:

- Enable built-in System Applications on a Zebra Android device.

- Disable built-in System Applications on a Zebra Android device.

### Blacklist Configuration - Action

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to perform an Action to enable or disable a single built-in System Application on Zebra Android devices.

All built-in System Applications are enabled by default on Zebra Android devices.
Enabling a built-in System Application allows it to be freely launched, either by the Device User or programmatically by other Applications.
Disabling a built-in System Application prevents it from being launched, either by the Device User or programmatically by other Applications.

Since a built-in System Application is built-in, you cannot uninstall it from a device, even if you do not wish it to be used.
To prevent the use of a built-in System Application, you can disable it and thereby prevent its use, even though it remains installed.

The value of this Managed Configuration specifies an Action value of ***Enable*** or ***Disable***.
Depending on the Action value chosen, one of the following Managed Configurations must also be specified to provide the package name of the built-in System Application that is to be enabled or disabled.

- When the Action value ***Enable*** is chosen, the Managed Configuration **Blacklist Configuration - Action Allow System Package** must be used to specify the package name that identifies the built-in System Application to be enabled.

- When the Action value ***Disable*** is chosen, the Managed Configuration **Blacklist Configuration - Action Disallow System Package** must be used to specify the package name that identifies the built-in System Application to be disabled.


### Blacklist Configuration - Action Allow System Package Name

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to specify a package name to identify a built-in System Application to be ***Enabled*** and should be specified if and only if the Action value ***Enable*** is chosen for the Managed Configuration **Blacklist Configuration - Action**.


### Blacklist Configuration - Action Disallow System Package Name

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to specify a package name to identify a built-in System Application to be ***Disabled*** and should be specified if and only if the Action value ***Disable*** is chosen for the Managed Configuration **Blacklist Configuration - Action**.

## Bluetooth Configuration

This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to include configuration within a transaction step to:

- Configure whether the device is *Discoverable* via Bluetooth.

- Configure whether the device will accept new Bluetooth Pairings.


### Bluetooth Configuration - Action

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to perform an Action to manage a list of rules that control Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing*.

Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* allows new Bluetooth Pairings to be automatically completed without Device User interaction, if permitted by defined rules.
Since the list of rules is empty by default on Zebra Android devices, Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* is disabled by default, hence Device User interaction will be required to complete any new Bluetooth Pairings.

The value of this Managed Configuration specifies an Action value of ***Add*** or ***Remove***, thus allowing the list of rules to be managed.
Depending on the Action value chosen, one of the following Managed Configurations must also be specified:

- When the Action value ***Add*** is chosen:

    - The Managed Configuration **Bluetooth Configuration - Action Add Rule Name** MUST be used to specify the name of the new rule to be added.

    - At least ONE of the Managed Configurations **Bluetooth Configuration - Action Add Rule Device Class** or **Bluetooth Configuration - Action Add Rule Device Upper Address Part** MUST be used to specify the criteria that the new rule will use to determine which new Bluetooth Pairings will be allowed.

- When the Action value ***Remove*** is chosen, at least ONE of the the Managed Configurations **Bluetooth Configuration - Action Remove Rule Name**, **Bluetooth Configuration - Action Remove Rule Device Class**, or **Bluetooth Configuration - Action Remove Rule Device Upper Address Part** MUST be used to specify the information that will be used to determine which rule or rules, which have matching information, will be removed.

### Bluetooth Configuration - Action Add Rule Name

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to specify a name for a new rule to be added to the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* and should be specified if and only if the Action value ***Add*** is chosen for the Managed Configuration **Bluetooth Configuration - Action**.

### Bluetooth Configuration - Action Add Rule Device Class

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to specify the *Device Class* for a new rule to be added to the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* and should be specified if and only if the Action value ***Add*** is chosen for the Managed Configuration **Bluetooth Configuration - Action**.

When a *Device Class* is specified for a rule, Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* will automatically complete new Bluetooth Pairings for Bluetooth devices that have the specified *Device Class*.

### Bluetooth Configuration - Action Add Rule Device Upper Address Part

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to specify the *Device Upper Address Part* for a new rule to be added to the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* and should be specified if and only if the Action value ***Add*** is chosen for the Managed Configuration **Bluetooth Configuration - Action**.

When a *Device Upper Address Part* is specified for a rule, Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* will automatically complete new Bluetooth Pairings for Bluetooth devices that have the specified *Device Upper Address Part* in the upper part of their *Bluetooth Address*.

### Bluetooth Configuration - Action Remove Rule Name

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to specify the name of an existing rule to be removed from the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* and should be specified if and only if the Action value ***Remove*** is chosen for the Managed Configuration **Bluetooth Configuration - Action**.

Any existing rule that has the specified name will be removed.

### Bluetooth Configuration - Action Remove Rule Device Class

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to specify the *Device Class* of an existing rule to be removed from the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* and should be specified if and only if the Action value ***Remove*** is chosen for the Managed Configuration **Bluetooth Configuration - Action**.

Any existing rule or rules that have the specified *Device Class* will be removed.

### Bluetooth Configuration - Action Remove Rule Device Upper Address Part

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to specify the *Device Upper Address Part* of an existing rule to be removed from the list of rules that control the operation of Bluetooth *Auto-Pairing* and should be specified if and only if the Action value ***Remove*** is chosen for the Managed Configuration **Bluetooth Configuration - Action**.

Any existing rule or rules that have the specified *Device Upper Address Part* will be removed.

### Bluetooth Configuration - Discoverability

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to configure whether the device is *Discoverable* via Bluetooth.

Zebra Android devices are NOT *Discoverable* via Bluetooth by default except when the Bluetooth Pairing screen of the Settings UI is active.

The value of this Managed Configuration can change this default behavior:

- When the value ***Off*** is chosen, the default behavior will be in effect and the device will not be *Discoverable* via Bluetooth except when the Bluetooth Pairing screen of the Settings UI is active.

- When the value ***On*** is chosen, the default behavior will be overridden and the device will be *Discoverable* via Bluetooth whenever Bluetooth is enabled (turned on).




### Bluetooth Configuration - New Pairings

This Managed Configuration allows an Administrator using an EMM to configure whether the device will accept new Bluetooth Pairings.

Zebra Android devices will accept new Bluetooth Pairings by default.

The value of this Managed Configuration can change this default behavior:

- When the value ***Off*** is chosen, the default behavior will be overridden and the device will not accept new Bluetooth Pairings.

- When the value ***On*** is chosen, the default behavior will be in effect and the device will accept new Bluetooth Pairings.

## DHCP Option Configuration

This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to include configuration within a transaction step to configure the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Client on Zebra Android devices.

The DHCP Client on the device sends a DHCP Request to a DHCP Server and receives back a DHCP Acknowledgment. A DHCP Request sent by a device can contain information about the device or the DHCP Client, and can contain requests for additional information from the DHCP Server. A DHCP Acknowledgment sent by the DHCP Server contains the IP Address assigned to the device by the DHCP Server along with other related information and any additional information requested by the device in the DHCP Request.

DHCP Options are variable-length strings that are identified by DHCP Options Numbers that can be included in a DHCP Request or a DHCP Acknowledgment to convey information between a DHCP Client and a DHCP Server. From the point of view of the device where the DHCP Client is running, a DHCP Option can allow the DHCP Client to *Send* information to the DHCP Server or can allow the DHCP Client to *Request* the DHCP Server to return information to the DHCP Client.

This Managed Configuration group allows an Administrator using an EMM to:

- Configure the DHCP Client on a Zebra Android device to *Send* additional information to the DHCP Server when requesting an IP Address.
