## Overview

ActiveEdge Touch Zone provides a customizable "application drawer" that gives users a quick and easy way to launch an organizations's apps or functions from inside any other app or task.

A customizable drawer (shown above) can hold as many as three launching icons, giving workers convenient one-touch access to workflow or line-of-business apps. A second drawer accessed from the opposite edge of the screen, can hold an additional app, launch an intent or perform other tasks. Once configured, soft keys near the perimeter of the display provide access to those frequently used applications or functions.
