## Overview

Zebra ActiveEdge Touch Zone provides a customizable "App Drawer" that gives users a quick and easy way to launch an organizations's apps or functions from inside any other app or task.

A customizable drawer (shown above) can hold as many as three launching icons, giving workers convenient one-touch access to workflow or line-of-business apps. A second drawer accessed from the opposite edge of the screen can hold an additional app, launch an intent or be configured to perform other tasks.
