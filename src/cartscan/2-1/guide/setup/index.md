## Associate the Devices  

Once the CartScan software is installed on a PC and mobile device, the two must be associated before the solution can be used. The first time a mobile device makes contact with a particular PC, it initiates a Bluetooth pairing request and tries to connect. This step can take a some time and technical know-how. 

>**Zebra recommends that an IT associate perform this step ahead of time**.

**IMPORTANT**: Multiple mobile devices can be paired via Bluetooth to an individual PC, but only one mobile device can connect to CartScanPCWedge at a time.
