## Overview

The **Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation** is a standard for certifying the security of computing devices and systems. Often referred to as Common Criteria or simply CC, the international standard **"establishes the general concepts and principles of IT security evaluation and specifies the general model of evaluation**," according to the [ISO/IEC 15408 web page](https://www.iso.org/standard/50341.html). It does so in the various sections of the standard, which "**in its entirety is meant to be used as the basis for evaluation of security properties of IT products**." 

In essence, **Common Criteria specifies a framework under which computing devices can be secured in a consistent way**, allowing system suppliers to credibly claim that their devices behave predictably with regard to security and vulnerability to exploits. The standard also defines terms used, establishes the concept of a **Target of Evaluation (TOE)** and its evaluation context, and describes the intended audience for the evaluation criteria. 

Other key concepts include **Protection Profiles**, which package security requirements and the topics of conformance, and **Security Targets**, which define statements of the security needs of a specific TOE in a specific use case. Companies adhering to Common Criteria can specify **Security Functional Requirements** (SFAs) and **Security Assurance Requirements** (SARs) for specific Security Targets, which can then be evaluated by testing labs to determine whether they meet those claims using standardized and repeatable testing methods.
