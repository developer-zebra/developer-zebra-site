## Overview

Managed Configurations are specifications developed by Google and the Android community to remotely configure installed applications, apply application restrictions and deploy these configurations through an EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management). This enables DataWedge administrators to remotely specify settings and enforce policies, such as:
* **Securely mass deploy** the same data capture configurations for DataWedge across all devices.
* **Lock the DataWedge configuration** to prevent unexpected changes.
* **Restrict access to DataWedge APIs** by limiting access only to approved applications.

A schema defines the DataWedge features available for consumption by the EMM, providing the information necessary to present to the EMM's corresponding data-driven UI. This mechanism integrates DataWedge remote configuration within the EMM for seamless operation and allows Zebra to release a new schema as soon as new features are available for use. DataWedge and the Zebra schema are available from the Google Play Store and must be used together to leverage DataWedge with its managed configurations to perform data capture.

<!-- 
DataWedge Managed Configurations allow administrators to remotely manage Zebra Android mobile devices by configuring settings, adding restrictions and enforcing policies, such as:

- Mass deployment of the same DataWedge configurations across all devices in an organization
- Prevent user access of DataWedge UI to avoid unexpected DataWedge configuration changes
- Restrict application use of the following types of [DataWedge intent APIs](../api):
  - Configuration
  - Notification
  - Query
  - Runtime
-->
DataWedge Managed Configuration is based on Android's Managed Configuration architecture introduced in Android 11. Prior to Android 11, these configurations are supported in [DataWedge Manager CSP](/mx/datawedgemgr). Moving forward, Zebra recommends administrators to transition to Managed Configuration, which will replace DataWedge Manager CSP.

## Requirements

Requirements for use of Managed Configurations with DataWedge:
* Zebra device with Android 11 or higher
* DataWedge schema, included with built-in DataWedge app on Zebra Android devices
* An EMM for device deployment

## Use Managed Configurations

This section provides general instructions to use Managed Configurations through an EMM. The EMM typically uses the Managed Configuration schema to generate a UI console for administrators to remotely configure DataWedge. The UI layout may vary depending on the EMM. Through this UI, the administrator can select the desired Managed Configurations. 

General instructions to use Managed Configurations:
1. **Declare the Managed Configuration in the your manifest.** To define your app's Managed Configuration options, place the following element within your manifest's `<application>` element:

        <meta-data 
            android:name="android.content.APP_RESTRICTIONS" 
            android:resource="@xml/app_restrictions" />

2. **Define Managed Configuration file.** Create a file named `app_restrictions.xml` in your app's `res/xml` directory. The structure of that file is described in the reference for [Restrictions Manager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/RestrictionsManager). The file has a single top-level `<restrictions>` element, which contains one `<restriction>` child element for every configuration option the
app has.
This automatically retrieves the corresponding schema for the app and makes the app available for deployment to the device(s) through the EMM.
2. **Configure app restrictions using Managed Configurations** as described in the schema. See [App Restrictions](#apprestrictions) section that follows, which describes the available options.
3. **Push a policy that deploys the created Managed Configurations to the device(s).**

## App Restrictions

DataWedge restrictions are divided into 3 separate categories listed below with the corresponding bundle names:

1. **Secure DataWedge Configuration -** Controls access to DataWedge UI to prevent unexpected configuration changes. Use [Configuration Security](#configurationsecurity) bundle.
2. **Control access to DataWedge intent APIs -** Restricts application use of different types of DataWedge intent APIs. Use [Intent API Access Control](#intentapiaccesscontrol) bundle.
3. **Secure mass deployment -** Securely mass deploy DataWedge configuration files across all devices in an organization. Use [Configuration Settings](#configurationsettings) bundle.

<!--
DataWedge restrictions are categorized into 3 different configuration bundles:

1. **Configuration Security -** This bundle contains restrictions which control the security of DataWedge configurations.
2. **Intent API Access Control -** This bundle contains restrictions which control access to DataWedge intent APIs.
3. **Configuration Settings -** This bundle contains configuration options related to mass deployment of configuration files and NextGen SimulScan template.
-->
## App Restriction Options

The following sections provide the options available for each of the configuration bundles.

### Configuration Security

Configuration Security controls the ability to lock the DataWedge configuration on the device once the configuration is deployed preventing undesired configuration changes by device users.

<table class="facelift" align="center" style="width:100%" border="1" padding="5px">
  <tr bgcolor="#dce8ef">
    <th>Restriction Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Display Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Automatic database import</td>
    <td style="text-align:center">0</td>
	<td>Off</td>
    <td>Turn off auto import feature. This helps prevent undesired DataWedge configuration updates after the final configuration is deployed. </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center">1</td>
    <td>On</td>
    <td>Turn on auto import feature. This automatically imports the DataWedge configuration file when present. </td>
