## Overview

**Enterprise Keyboard Configuration** enables the use of an [Enterprise Keyboard](/enterprise-keyboard), whether standard (default) or custom layout, as the IME (input method editor) with an associated app in a DataWedge profile. This facilitates the use of different keyboard layouts without the need to modify an app, activating Enterprise Keyboard automatically as the on-screen keyboard for user input. A custom Enterprise Keyboard layout (`.encrypted` file) can be created and configured with [Enterprise Keyboard Designer](/ekd).

**Requirements:**

- DataWedge v7.4.44 or higher.
- Enterprise Keyboard v3.2 or higher. Zebra devices with Android 7.x Nougat or higher are pre-installed with Enterprise Keyboard v1.7 or higher. For Zebra devices with Android 6.x Marshmallow or lower, Enterprise Keyboard v1.7 or higher is included with any LifeGuard update.
- Enterprise Keyboard must be set as the default IME in Android Settings on the device.
- The Enterprise Keyboard layout definition file (`.encrypted`) is placed on the device in directory `/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config`.

Enterprise Keyboard Configuration options include:

- Enable/Disable Enterprise Keyboard
- Select a layout for the keyboard

Enterprise Keyboard Configuration is disabled and cannot be configured if one of the following conditions exist:

- Enterprise Keyboard is not the default IME in Android on the device.
- A `.encrypted` file is not found in `/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config` directory.
- Enterprise Keyboard on the device is lower than version 3.2, which does not support custom layouts.

### Enable/Disable

Enable/disable Enterprise Keyboard used with the DataWedge profile. If enabled, the selected layout for Enterprise Keyboard automatically appears within the associated app during a profile or activity switch/change when appearing in the foreground. If disabled, Enterprise Keyboard does not appear within the associated app.

### Select layout

Select a layout for the keyboard. The available layouts are populated from a custom generated `.encrypted` file (for example _EKBCustomLayouts.encrypted_) located in folder `/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config` on the device. If the file does not exist, Enterprise Keyboard Configuration is disabled and cannot be configured. The Layout group name is based on the `.encrypted` file name. See [Enterprise Keyboard](/enterprise-keyboard/latest/guide/settings) for more information.
