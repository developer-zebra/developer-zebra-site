## Overview

DataWedge provides barcode scanning and processing services for Zebra devices running Android. Included with every Zebra device, DataWedge enables all apps on the device (whether stock or added later) to acquire scanned data without using scanner APIs directly. DataWedge can be easily configured to automatically provide scanning services whenever a particular app is launched; to use a particular scanner, reader or other sensor; and to manipulate acquired data according to simple options or complex rules. 

### Language Support

DataWedge has been approved to run on device operating systems localized for the following languages:

* English
* French
* German
* Italian
* Spanish
* Simplified Chinese
* Traditional Chinese

For more information about approved languages or to download a localized operating system, please [contact Zebra Technical Support](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/about-zebra/contact-zebra/contact-tech-support.html).

#### This document applies to:
* **DataWedge 6.6.x**, which requires:
* **Scanner Framework 18.0.9.0** or higher, and
* **SimulScan 1.9 or higher** (on [devices that support SimulScan](../../../../simulscan))

To learn more about DataWedge APIs, read [DataWedge APIs - Benefits & Usage Scenarios](https://developer.zebra.com/community/android/android-forums/android-blogs/blog/2017/06/27/datawedge-apis-benefits-challenges) by Zebra engineer Darryn Campbell.

### New in DataWedge 6.6

* **New [serial input options](../input/serial) allow DataWedge to specify communications parameters for a scanner or other device connected to a serial port and used to acquire data**.

* **[Import Reporting](../settings/#reporting) displays the results of imported databases and Profiles, allowing administrators to easily identify source/destination differences and make adjustments to compensate**.

* **A new [SET_REPORTING_OPTIONS](../api/setreportingoptions) API provides control of Reporting features with intents**. 

* **The [SET_CONFIG](../api/setconfig) API now configures multiple plug-ins with a single intent action**. 

-----

* Scan and process all [major barcode symbologies](../input/barcode/#decoderselection)
* Acquire barcodes, images, text, phone numbers, mag-stripe and other data
* Set DataWedge to acquire scanned data for one or more apps
* Create Profiles to implement specific DataWedge features for individual apps 
* Enable/Disable decoding of individual symbologies to improve speed
* Set parameters for individual barcodes, scanners and readers
* Format output according to simple or custom rules
* Use plug-ins for data input, output and processing
* Import and export settings 
* Remotely configure and mass-deploy settings via MDM  
* Restore settings to factory defaults
* Apply remote settings changes immediately

&#52;. If the DataWedge version on the device is different than that of this guide, [return to the Techdocs tile page](../../../../) and select the appropriate version from the drop-down menu in the DataWedge tile.

It also might be helpful to visit the [Zebra support site](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/sitesearch.html?q=integrator%20guide) and download a device-specific Integrator Guide for reference. 

<!--
#### Download an Integrator Guide
For each of its devices, Zebra publishes an Integrator Guide containing information specific to that device. For products that include DataWedge, **the Integrator Guide includes a chapter covering only those DataWedge capabilities available on the device**. A search for the term "integrator" at the [Zebra Support Portal](https://portal.motorolasolutions.com/Support/US-EN/Search?searchType=simple&searchTerm=integrator) yields a result similar to the image below. Narrow the seach by adding the device model.

#### Update DataWedge (Windows only)
**DataWedge is part of the device OS image** and relies on specific components built into that image. It cannot be downloaded separately or updated without also updating the entire device, a process that **can result in loss of user data and/or user-installed applications**. It should therefore be considered only after all other options have been eliminated. **Zebra recommends consulting with a Zebra partner before upgrading a device OS image**. 

**This option is not available for Android devices**.
