title: DataWedge Profiles
description: Each app that uses DataWedge must be associated with a Profile, which contains options for determining how the data will be acquired (input), processed (data formatting) and delivered to the app (output). Details about functionality and usage of each of the input, processing and output options can be found in the links below. For general details about how Profiles work, see the Architecture Overview page.
