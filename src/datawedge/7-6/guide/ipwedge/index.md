## Overview

IPWedge is a small Windows app that monitors a network port and receives scanned data sent by devices using the DataWedge IP Output Plug-in. The receiving PC inserts the data as keystrokes into the foreground application or the Windows Clipboard, essentially using the device as a wireless scanner. 

## Setup 

### Prerequisites
Using IPWedge requires the following: 

* A PC with Windows XP, Vista or 7
* Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 (or later) installed
* A Zebra device running Android 4.4 KitKat (or later)
* DataWedge for Android 1.5 (or later)

### Set up IPWedge

&#49;. [Visit the Zebra Support Portal](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads.html), enter "IPwedge" in the search box and **download the appropriate version for the target device**. 

&#50;. **Install the .zip file** on the system to which the scanned data will be sent. 

&#51;. **Run the IPWedge app**. A screen appears similar to the image below. **Make a note of the IP address and port number** (in the red box).

> **Note: This default port number is the same as that of the IP Output Plug-in** on the device.

&#52;. **Open the IPWedge app** from the Windows Start menu or tap on the IPWedge icon in the System Tray and select Options. 

The IPWedge Options panel appears similar to the image(s) below.

_Keystroke Options_. 
<br>

<img style="height:250px" src="03_ipwedge.jpg"/>
_Clipboard Options_. 
<br>

&#53;. **Make any required changes** to Options in the General, Keystroke and Clipboard tabs. **Click OK on each tab** to save settings. 

The PC is now ready to receive data from devices running DataWedge with the IP Output Plug-in (with IP address and port settings matching those of the PC). For device setup instructions, see [IP Output](../output/ip).
