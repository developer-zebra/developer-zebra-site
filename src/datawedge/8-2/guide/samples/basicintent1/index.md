##Overview 
This sample demonstrates how to use DataWedge to receive scanned barcode data through an Android intent. 

Available actions in this sample: 
* Display the following for each decoded barcode:  
  * scan source 
  * scan data 
  * decoder type 

>**Note**: This application is intended for demonstration purposes only. It is provided as-is without guarantee or warranty and may be modified to suit individual needs. The appearance of sample app screens can vary by sample app version, Android version, and screen size.

##Requirements
* DataWedge (built-in all Zebra devices) is running on the device.
* DataWedge profile created and associated with this sample app. See instructions below.

##Using This Sample
Configure DataWedge to output scans via intent:
1. Launch the DataWedge via Apps > DataWedge.
2. Select a Profile, e.g. Profile0 which is used for all apps not explicitly assigned a profile.
3. Confirm the following settings:

    * The profile is **enabled**
    * Barcode input is **enabled**
    * Intent output is **enabled**

4. Configure the intent output as follows:
    * Intent action: **com.basicintent1.ACTION** (to match value defined in the `strings.xml` file)
    * Intent category: (leave blank)
    * Intent delivery: **Broadcast intent**
