## Overview

Device Diagnostic Tool supports two modes of operation:

1. **Admin mode -** The administrator can access app settings, modify test configurations and run each individual test. This is the default mode.
2. **User mode -** The user is restricted to only run tests. There is no access to app settings, test configurations nor individual tests. To set user mode, disable <i>admin_mode</i> as referenced in the [Configuration](../configuration#configurationfile) section.
   <br>

## <!-- -->

## Launch the App

Run Device Diagnostic Tool using one of the following methods:

1. **Manually using the User Interface** - The user launches Device Diagnostic Tool and runs the tests manually. See [User Interface](#userinterface) section below.
2. **Remotely with an EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management) system** - Launch Device Diagnostic Tool in the background and generate a log using command: <br>`adb shell am broadcast -n "com.symbol.selfdiagnostics/com.symbol.selfdiagnostics.SESReceiver"`
<br>
<p>Only one of the methods should be used to run Device Diagnostic Tool, otherwise unexpected behavior can occur.</p>

## User Interface

When launching the app for the first time, the main screen displays the tests available to run:

<img style="height:400px" src="mainscreen.png"/>

_Main screen_
<br/>
If tests have already been conducted, the test name is followed by the date when the last test was conducted.
<br />
<br />

Tap **Run Tests** from the main screen to execute all the tests. Test execution is based on the tests selected in the **Configure Tests** screen. Once the test is initiated, the user is prompted to perform additional actions during test execution of the following: Scanner Test, Button Test, Touch Screen Test, and Audio Test. It is recommended for all tests to be performed while the device is in normal use, i.e. not docked in a cradle or connected via USB to a computer. Once testing is complete, the results are displayed:
<br /><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="left" style="height:25px" src="testpassed.png"/><b>Pass -</b> Test executed and passed. Result passed test criteria.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="left" style="height:25px" src="testfailed.png"/><b>Fail -</b>Test executed and did not meet the test criteria.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img align="left" style="height:20px" src="testinfo.png"/><b>Information -</b>Data retrieved and displayed.
<br /><br />
Alternatively, in admin mode individual tests can be performed by tapping on the individual test category and then tapping <b>Run Tests</b>.
<br>

**Test failed** and **test timed-out** result to the same red hazard icon.
<br><br>

**Help** option is available by tapping on the top right menu of the main screen. This links to the [Device Diagnostics Tool support portal](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/utilities/device-diagnostic-tool.html).

<br>
<p><b>Note:</b> When performing the Scanner Test on TC55, the user must long press the scanner button for it to be detected.</p>
<br>

### Button Test

The user is prompted to press the hard buttons on the device: scan trigger (left or right), push-to-talk, volume up, and volume down. Results:

<br>
<p><b>Note:</b> If hard key buttons are remapped, the Button test does not work as expected.</p>
<br>

### Touch Screen Test

The user is prompted to touch each grid box on the screen
