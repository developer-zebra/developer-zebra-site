## Overview

As part of Zebra DNA Visibility Console (ZDVC) server, Device Tracker runs on a supported Windows-based server. Device Tracker client runs on supported [Zebra devices](../about/#supporteddevices). This section provides system requirements and instructions for install and setup for the solution.

Solution components:
* **ZDVC server** - ZDVC server includes Device Tracker and [PowerPrecision Console](/ppc/latest/guide/about). Device Tracker collects and processes device data for tracking misplaced devices.
* **Web portal** - ZDVC centralized dashboard for monitoring device presence, device tracking, and battery status.
* **Device Tracker client** - reports device presence status and information (such as remaining battery and charging status) to server

Before installing, ensure to prepare additional steps for system setup - consult your local IT department for assistance:
 * **Install SSL certificate** (procured by a signed Certificate Authority) - configured on server for secure HTTPS communication
 * **Open specific incoming and outgoing ports** - for server communication through the firewall, based on ports specified during server installation
 * **Add DNS (Domain Name Server) Entry** - an entry is added to the DNS to map the server IP address to the domain 

<font color="red"><b>Important:</b> An SSL Certificate is required from a third-party certificate authority (CA), such as Verisign or Thawte. Any self-signed certificate or one issued by a non third-party CA will not work. The .pfx certificate must contain the complete certificate chain, including intermediate certificates.</font>

##Server Install & Setup
Download ZDVC server from [Zebra Support and Downloads](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/productivity-apps/device-tracker.html). Install ZDVC server via a new install or an upgrade from an existing install on the supported system that meets the specified requirements. The user must have the appropriate system privileges to install the server. After server installation, further network and certificate setup is required to allow communication between the server and devices via DNS and firewall. Instructions for server installation and setup:

###Server Prerequisites
The following are the prerequisites required for the server: <br>
1. **DNS (Domain Name Server) Setup.** ZDVC server runs in a domain, for example _company.com_. An entry with the server hostname and corresponding IP address is required in the DNS server for name resolution. The DNS server and ZDVC server are required to be on the same network. Contact your local IT Administrator to configure the domain to IP address mapping. 

2. **SSL Certificate.** ZDVC requires an SSL certificate for secure communications. The certificate must be in .pfx format and set with a password. See [Server Certificate](./#servercertificate) section for details.

3. **Open Inbound/Outbound Ports on the Firewall.** The appropriate ports are required to be opened for inbound/outbound network traffic flow through the firewall for communication between the server and devices. The UI and Backend Server ports are specified during server install. The method to open the ports depends on the firewall software used by the network administrator. 

	* Backend Server (data) Port: inbound (e.g. port 8080)  
	* Web Portal (UI) Port: inbound and outbound (e.g. port 8443)
<br>

###Server Certificate
An SSL certificate is needed for secure connections. Generate the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) with private key and submit it to the trusted CA. The CA issues the SSL Certificate signed with the public key (in .p7b format). Use this issued certificate to generate the SSL certificate with the private key. The final, complete SSL certificate contains the server certificate, any intermediate certificates, the public key and private key. The procedure to accomplish this is separated into two sections below:
* **Procure server certificate** (.p7b format) with public key 
* **Generate complete SSL certificate** (.pfx format) with both public and private keys 

If the server certificate with public key already exists, skip to the second section _Generate complete SSL Certificate_. If the complete SSL certificate already exists, skip to section _Server Installation_. <br><br>
**Procure server certificate:** Create a private key and generate the CSR. Submit the CSR to the CA for signing. The server certificate issued should be in .p7b format.
1. Download and install the SSL toolkit [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/) for Windows. Follow the instructions stated to download the file based on your Windows configuration.<br>
2. Add a new "openSSL" environment variable to the Windows system and set the value to the location where openSSL is installed (e.g. "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\").<br>
3. Create a folder named "ServerCert".  Open the command prompt to this folder path.<br>
4. Create a private key. It prompts to enter the passphrase - _make note of this passphrase_, which is used in Device Tracker. Run the command:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`openSSL genrsa -des3 -out dtrkdemo.key 2048`<br>
where "dtrkdemo.key" can be replaced with a custom file name.
5. Create a CSR based on the new private key. Run the command:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`openSSL req key dtrkdemo.key -new -out dtrkdemo.csr`<br>
where "dtrkdemo.key" (same file name as in step 4) and "dtrkdemo.csr" (new file created) can be replaced with custom file names. 
It prompts to enter the private key password (created in step 5). Enter in the required fields when prompted (the information entered must match that registered with the CA):
   * **Country Name** - Enter the two-letter code without punctuation for country, for example: US or CA.
   * **State or Province** - Enter the full state or province name without abbreviation, for example: California.
   * **Locality or City** - Enter the city or town name without abbreviation, for example: Berkeley or Saint Louis.
   * **Organization Name** - Enter the company. If the company or department contains a special character such as "&" or "@", the symbol must be spelled out or omitted in order to enroll successfully. 
   * **Organizational Unit Name** - Enter the name of the department or organization unit making the request. This is optional, to skip, press Enter on the keyboard.
   * **Common Name** - Enter the fully qualified host name, for example: "hostname.company.com". _This is the same name to be used in the Server Installation in step 5 for the Domain name._
   * **Email Address** - Enter the contact email address.<br>
When prompted for the challenge password, it is not required - _do not supply one_. 
6. Submit the CSR created to the CA. They will supply a certificate in .p7b format, e.g. ssl_certificate.p7b.

<!-- **Note:** Symantec certificates can only be used on web servers using the Common Name specified during enrollment. For example, a certificate for the domain "zebra.com" will receive a warning if accessing a site named "www.zebra.com" or "secure.zebra.com" since "www.zebra.com" and "secure.zebra.com" are different from "zebra.com." <br>
-->
<!--
E. Run the following command to generate a private key and CSR file: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`openSSL req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout zdvc_private_key.key -out zdvc_cert_sign_req.csr`<br>
 Where "zdvc_cert_sign_req.csr" and "zdvc_private_key.key" can be replaced with custom file names.<br> 
F. Enter in the required fields when prompted:

   * **Country Name** - Enter the two-letter code without punctuation for country, for example: US or CA.
   * **State or Province** - Enter the full state or province name without abbreviation, for example: California.
   * **Locality or City** - Enter the city or town name without abbreviation, for example: Berkeley or Saint Louis.
   * **Company** - Enter the company. If the company or department contains a special characteres such as "&" or "@" the symbol must be spelled out or omitted in order to enroll successfully. 
   * **Organizational Unit** - Enter the name of the department or organization unit making the request. This is optional, to skip, press Enter on the keyboard.
   * **Common Name** - Enter the Host and Domain Name, following the same format as these examplese: "www.zebra.com" or "zebra.com". **Note:** Symantec certificates can only be used on web servers using the Common Name specified during enrollment. For example, a certificate for the domain "zebra.com" will receive a warning if accessing a site named "www.zebra.com" or "secure.zebra.com" since "www.zebra.com" and "secure.zebra.com" are different from "zebra.com." <br>

 G. Enter the challenge password when prompted. _This is the password needed when generating the certificate in .pfx format._<br>
 H. A .csr file is created in the "CSR_Request" folder. Submit this file to the CA to have it signed. <br>
 I. Obtain the certificate bundle from the CA in .pkcs format and certificate in .p7b format (which includes the public key). -->
**Generate complete SSL Certificate:** Zebra requires the certificate be procured in .p7b format and combined with the private key (.key file) to generate the SSL certificate in .pfx file format. If the certificate is in a different format, use an SSL certificate converter tool to convert to the proper format.  <br>
1. Create an ssl_certificate.cer file with the command:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in ssl_certificate.p7b -out ssl_certificate.cer`<br>
where "ssl_certificate.p7b" is the certificate issued by the CA.
2. Create SSL certificate "ssl_certificate.pfx" with command (using the private key password created from step 4 in the previous section):<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`openssl pkcs12 -export -in ssl_certificate.cer -inkey dtrkdemo.key -out ssl_certificate.pfx`<br>
where "dtrkdemo.key" is the private key generated from step 4 in the previous section and "ssl_certificate.cer" is the file generated from the previous step 1.
3. Import the SSL certificate on the server. Double-click the certificate on the local computer and follow the Certificate Import wizard.
4. Use SSL certificate "ssl_certificate.pfx" and the private key password for Device Tracker server installation and setup in the sections that follow.
<!--
A. Create an empty directory named "generated_certs" to contain the .pfx certificate.<br>
B. Copy the following certificate files to "generated_certs" folder: primary certificate (e.g. "ssl_certificate.p7b"), private key (e.g. "zdvc_private_key.key"), and intermediate CA certificate (e.g. "IntermediateCA.cer").  _The intermediate CA certificate is optional - use if required in the certificate chain._  <br>
C. Open a command prompt. Execute the following command to generate "ssl_certificate.cer":<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in ssl_certificate.p7b -out ssl_certificate.cer`
<br>
D. At the command prompt, execute the following command:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`openssl pkcs12 -export -in ssl_certificate.cer -inkey zdvc_private_key.key -out ssl_certificate.pfx -certfile IntermediateCA.cer`
	<br>
	Where "-certfile IntermediateCA.cer" is optional.
<br>
E. When prompted, enter the certificate password to export "ssl_certificate.pfx". This is the challenge password specified in step 2.G. above.<br>
F. Copy the SSL certificate "ssl_certificate.pfx" with domain name “name.company.com” to a designated folder.

##Client Install & Setup
Install Device Tracker client on the supported Zebra device to register the device and transmit data to the server. Client install and setup can be accomplished either manually or remotely with Zebra's [StageNow](/stagenow/latest/about) or an EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management) system. 

###Client Installation
Steps for client installation on the device, which may be performed either manually or with an EMM (Enterprise Mobile Management):
1. Download Device Tracker client from [Zebra Support and Downloads](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software.html). Extract the files and folders.
2. Install DTRKClient.apk. 
3. If updating an existing client, reboot the device.

###Client Configuration
Configure the client settings either manually or remotely. For information on using CSP for remote configuration deployment, refer to [MX documentation](/mx/overview).
> WiFi sleep policy "Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep" must be set to "Always" on Android Marshmallow devices for Device Tracker to work in Doze mode. By default it is set to "Never".

####Manual Configuration
Steps for manual client configuration after installation:
1. Open Device Tracker client.
2. Tap "Yes" to "Ignore battery optimizations". This is required for the client to remain connected to the server while running in the background.
3. Tap the hamburger menu at the top right, then tap "Settings".  
4. Enter in the following information:
   * **Server URL** - URL for the server with port number and Device Tracker path specified, for example: **hostname.company.com:8080/zdvc/dtrk**, where "hostname.company.com:8080" is replaced with the appropriate hostname, domain and port number. The URL must not contain "https://" nor "http://".
   * **Server Auth Key** - UserName designated during server install
   * **Server Auth Password** - Password designated during server install
<br>
5. Tap the device back button to save the changes and return to the main screen.
Device Tracker client registers with the server and loads "Devices to be found".
<!--3. Tap "Allow" to "Allow Device Tracker to access this device's location". This is required to allow BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) locationing. -->

####Remote Configuration
After client installation, follow these steps to create StageNow profiles to remotely configure the client:
1. Disable Battery Optimization
2. Start Device Tracker Service
3. Configure Device Tracker settings with CSP
<!-- 2. Reboot device (refer to [Power Manager](http://techdocs.zebra.com/stagenow/latest/csp/power/) in StageNow documentation) -->

Detailed procedures for each follow in the sections below.

When using StageNow or any EMM system for remote configuration, use of the following special characters is not supported (for example, when setting the password): <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; (less than) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; (greater than) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#38; (ampersand) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#39; (single quote) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#34; (double quote) <br>

> Use of a StageNow profile which combines installation and configuration into a single profile is not supported. Two separate profiles need to be created:
1. Install Device Tracker application and start the service.
2. Configure Device Tracker settings.

**Steps to create StageNow profile to automatically bypass the device Battery Optimization pop-up message:**
