## Overview

Commercial deployment to devices requires an End-User License (also known as an "Activation ID" or AID) issued by Zebra Technologies for each device. Licenses are available for one-, three- and five-year terms, or a 90-day trial period. 

This guide explains the process of obtaining a Device Tracker license for commercial use and applying the license(s) to individual devices. A given license key can be activated on any number of devices up to the total quantity of licenses purchased.
