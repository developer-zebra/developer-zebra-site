## Overview

This section covers troubleshooting steps as well as Frequently Asked Questions.


##Troubleshooting
This section discusses common issues that can occur and possible solutions. Server log files can help identify any server errors or exceptions, located in default folder `\Program Files (x86)\Zebra Technologies\ZDVC\Backend Server\log`. 

###Issues related to server certificate
Possible issues or causes:
* **Server certificate is not signed by an authorized Certificate Authority.** Self-signed certificates do not meet the Device Tracker server requirement. See [Server Requirements](../setup).
* **Error "Unable to write 'random state'" occurs when generating the SSL certificate with OpenSSL.** The command prompt may need to be launched in "Run As Administrator" mode.
* **"Warning: Can't open config file [folder_path]/openssl.cnf" occurs when generating the SSL certificate with OpenSSL.** An OpenSSL variable may need to be set in the Windows system with the following command:
`set OPENSSL_CONF=c:\[folder_path]\openssl.cnf`<br>
where [folder_path] is the path to the OpenSSL directory.

###Cannot start server
It is possible the certificate password entered during ZDVC server installation does not match the actual certificate. Perform the server installation again to enter the correct certificate password.

###Cannot login or connect to server
Possible causes:
* **No communication between the server and web portal.** Verify there is communication between the server and web portal by checking whether an endpoint is accessible through the browser. This is accomplished by appending a single endpoint to the server URL. For example: `https://hostname.company.com:8081/zdvc/dtrk/admindevops/getDeviceStatisticsSummary`, where endpoint `/zdvc/dtrk/admindevops/getDeviceStatisticsSummary` is appended to server URL `https://hostname.company.com:8081`.<br>
Sample result string:
<br>
<br>
<i>
    {"neverConnected":43,"outOfService":8,"connected":16,"disconnected":276,"normal":254,"toBeFound":6,"findInProgress":14,"deviceFound":14,
    "charging":84,"batteryLow":37,"devicesTracked":335,"cannotFindDevice":2}
</i>
<br>
<br>
If the endpoint is not accessible, there is no communication between the server and web portal.  Verify that the server is running. It is possible that the certificate is invalid. 

* **Incorrect server ports.** The ports specified during [server installation](../setup#serverinstallation) must match the ports specified in files **.env** (from default folder: /Program Files/Zebra Technologies/ZDVC/WebUI) and **application.properties** (from default folder: /Program Files/Zebra Technologies/ZDVC/BackendServer/config). 


###Cannot import .csv file containing access point or device data
Make sure to have write permissions to the ZDVC folder and subfolders.

###Server information is outdated
Refresh the web server page if updated information is not seen in the server [Admin View](../admin).

###Device does not connect to server
Possible causes:
* Ensure the the **Server URL, Server Auth UserName** and **Server Auth Password** are entered correctly. The **Server URL** can be obtained from the **Settings** tab in the server [admin view](../admin) in the format: `hostname.company.com:8081/zdvc/dtrk`, where "hostname.company.com" and the port number "8081" is replaced with the appropriate information.
* The server certificate is not trusted - it must be a valid SSL certificate issued by a Certificate Authority, a [server requirement](../setup) for Device Tracker. Follow steps for [Server certificate validation](../setup#serversetup).

###Device does not chirp or there is a delay
"Could not refresh lost device details" may be seen at the bottom of the device tracking screen. This could be caused by the target device not reporting back to the server yet since initiating the device tracking. Wait for the [Reporting Frequency](../config) time interval to elapse. Otherwise, there could be network issues that need to be diagnosed.

###Device client app is unresponsive
There could be a network delay in contacting the server. Wait for some time to elapse and then retry. Otherwise check for network issues.

##FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions:
###How do I delete entries?
Currently there is no ability to delete device entries from the [admin view](../admin). Device records can be set to **[out of service](../admin)**, preventing them from being displayed the main dashboard. Alternatively, a [tag can be added](../admin#organizedevices) to the device to aid in categorization.

###Can I use a self-signed certificate?
An SSL Certificate is required from a third-party certificate authority (CA), such as Verisign or Thawte. Any self-signed certificate or one issued by a non third-party CA will not work. The .pfx certificate must contain the complete certificate chain, including intermediate certificates.

###What are the login credentials required to use Device Tracker?
**Web portal:** To access the web portal, enter the server URL in the browser based on your [installation](../setup#serverinstallation), for example: `https://hostname.company.com:8443/zdvc`, where "hostname.company.com:8443" is replaced with the appropriate domain and port number. The default super administrator user name is **SAdmin**. The password is the **SuperAdmin and DB Password** entered during [server installation](../setup#serverinstallation). [Additional users can be added](../admin#manageusers) based on Admin, Manager, and User roles.

**Client devices:** Devices must be configured with the Server URL, Server Auth Key, and Server Auth Password set during [server installation](../setup#serverinstallation).

###Why is a device not appearing on the "Devices to be found" list?
Another device/associate may have already initiated the search for the same device. In the [Admin View](../admin), refresh the page and filter by "Being Found" to check if the device is listed.
