## Overview

Device Tracker is a cloud-based scalable solution that easily tracks Zebra Android mobile devices, finds missing devices and helps prevent device inventory shrinkage. Misplaced or lost devices within a facility are tracked by leveraging existing Wi-Fi network infrastructure and utilizing Bluetooth technology and audio chirping to locate devices. When locating a device, Device Tracker identifies the general area where the device is located based on the Access Point (AP) it is connected to within the facility. The visual proximity indicator relies on Bluetooth beacon transmissions to determine the approximate location of the device. Audio can be played on the misplaced device to further pinpoint its location.
