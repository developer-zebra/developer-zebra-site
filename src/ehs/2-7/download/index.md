## Download EHS

Zebra recommends using the latest release of EHS whenever possible. The EHS 2.7 download includes two separate .apk files: one for the Zebra TC20 and TC25 devices, and another for all other [devices supported by EHS v2.7](../guide/about#supporteddevices). 

Download packages prior to EHS 2.5 include separate .apk packages for Jelly Bean and KitKat, plus an optional installer .apk that detects the target operating system and installs the correct EHS version automatically.

## Latest Release

Visit the [Enterprise Home Screen download page](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/utilities/enterprise-home-screen.html) to select a version for download. 

After download, proceed to the [EHS Setup page](../guide/setup).
