## Overview
To get Barcode data into an application, create a profile with two profile features selected:

* Barcode
* [Keystroke](../keystroke), [Intent](../intent), [IP](../IP) (Output)

The `Barcode` feature in the Profile Manager is responsible for reading data from the device's integrated barcode scanner and supports different types of barcode readers including laser, imager and internal camera. It also contains detailed parameters for scanner behavior as well as individual barcode symbology parameters.

The `Intent`, `Keystroke` or `IP` feature in the Profile Manager is used to define how the output from the Barcode scanner should be handled

* Intent - The Intent feature, in the Profile Manager, collects and sends data received from the Barcode scanner to your application using the Android Intent mechanism. To use this, you should be familiar with how to register to receive intents in your application as well as handling the data that is passed in. You will have the ability to configure how the intent is sent to your application in the profile itself.

* Keystroke - The Keystroke feature, in the Profile Manager, collects and sends data received from the Barcode scanner to your application by emulating keystrokes. You will have the option to control how the data is sent as well as if it should have any prefix or suffix automatically added using basic data formatting.

* IP - IP Output allows DataWedge to send captured data to a host computer via a network connection. Captured data can be sent over an IP network to a specified IP address and port using either TCP or UDP transport protocols.

## Name
The name field is used by the EMDK to identify this particular feature parameter set when you want to manage just part of the profile programmatically using the EMDK [ProfileManager](../../../api) API. This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../../../guide/profile-manager) for more information.

> **Note**: As of EMDK 6.8, DataWedge can no longer be configured for data capture through Profile Manager. Zebra recommends using the [DataWedge APIs](/datawedge/latest/guide/api/) instead. 

## Enabled
Enables or disables this feature. Default is enabled.

## Scanner Selection
Configures which scanning device to use for data capture.

* **Auto -** Automatically determines the best scanning device. If a Scan Module or Scan/MSR Module is installed on the MC40, then the 2D imager is selected. Otherwise the camera is selected.
* **Internal Laser 1 -** Scanning is performed using the internal 1D laser scanner.
* **Internal Imager 1 -** Scanning is performed using the internal 2D scanner or MSR module.
* **Internal Camera 1 -** Scanning is performed with the rear-facing camera.
* **Pluggable Laser 1 -** Scanning is performed using an external 1D laser scanner plugged into the device.
* **Bluetooth Imager 1 -** Scanning is performed using an RS507 over Bluetooth.
* **RS5000 Pluggable Imager -** Scanning is performed using an RS5000 pluggable scanner.
* **RS6000 Bluetooth Imager -** Scanning is performed using an RS6000 over Bluetooth.
* **DS3678 Bluetooth Imager -** Scanning is performed using a DS3678 over Bluetooth. 
* **DS3608 Pluggable Imager -** Scanning is performed using a DS3608 pluggable scanner.

<!-- removed 1/26/18 per eng TUT-22329
The following Bluetooth scanners are supported: 

* **Zebra RS507** Cordless Ring Scanner
* **RS6000 Bluetooth Ring Scanner** (when used with WT6000 only)  
 -->

Bluetooth scanners are supported according to the following rules:

* **To initially configure the RS507** in a Profile, the scanner must be paired and connected.
* **After initial configuration**, the Bluetooth scanner can be enabled and disabled in the Profile even if it is disconnected from the device. However, to configure reader parameters, decoders and other scanner settings, the Bluetooth scanner must be connected.
* **The device will not automatically reconnect** to a Bluetooth scanner if that scanner is connected while it is using a different auto-selected scanner. To re-enable a Bluetooth scanner, connect the scanner and select it in the Profile or re-choose the Auto select option.
* **Auto-selection and Battery Swap -** If Scanner selection is set to Auto and the RS507 was enabled prior to a battery swap, DataWedge will continue working with that RS507 scanner upon reconnection after the battery is swapped. If the RS507 does not reconnect with after the swap, DataCapture will revert to the current default scanner.
<!-- <!-- 1/30/18 removed per eng. TUT-22683
* **The RS6000 Bluetooth scanner when used with Android N devices-** does not support the `disconnectOnExit` API even though the `isParamSupported`("disconnectonExit") method call might return a "true" value. 
 -->
## Use Auto when not supported

When importing a Profile, this option sets the Scanner Selection to Auto if the scanner type contained in the incoming Profile is not supported on the target device. 


## Keep Enabled on Suspend 
This mode is supported on Bluetooth and pluggable scanners only, and might result in faster battery drain than would otherwise be expected while in suspend mode. 

**Note: The Zebra computing device will wake from suspend mode when the RS507 scan trigger is pressed**.

* Check ISBT Table - The ISBT specification includes a table that lists several types of ISBT barcodes that are commonly used in pairs. If ISBT128 Concat Mode is set, enable Check ISBT Table to concatenate only those pairs found in this table. Other types of ISBT codes are not concatenated.
* Security Level - The scanner offers four levels of decode security for Code 128 barcodes. Select increasing levels of security for decreasing levels of barcode quality. There is an inverse relationship between security and scanner aggressiveness, so choose only that level of security necessary for any given application.
	* Security Level 0 - This setting allows the scanner to operate in its most aggressive state, while providing sufficient security in decoding most "in-spec" barcodes.
	* Security Level 1 - This setting eliminates most misdecodes.
	* Security Level 2 - Select this option if Security level 1 fails to eliminate misdecodes.
	* Security Level 3 - If Security Level 2 is selected and misdecodes still occur, select this security level. Be advised, selecting this option is an extreme measure against mis-decoding severely out of spec barcodes. Selecting this level of security significantly impairs the decoding ability of the scanner. If this level of security is needed, try to improve the quality of the barcodes.

* **Supplemental2 -** Enables or disables the length 2 supplementals.

* **Supplemental5 -** Enables or disables the length 2 supplementals.

* **Supplemental Mode -**
	* **No Supplementals -** the scanner is presented with a UPC/EAN plus supplemental symbol, the
	scanner decodes UPC/EAN and ignores the supplemental characters.
	* **Supplemental Always -** the scanner only decodes UPC/EAN symbols with supplemental characters, and ignores symbols without supplementals.
	* **Supplements Auto -** the scanner decodes UPC/EAN symbols with supplemental characters immediately. If the symbol does not have a supplemental, the scanner must decode the barcode the number of times set via UPC/EAN Supplemental Redundancy before transmitting its data to confirm that there is no supplemental.
	* **Supplemental Smart -** Enables smart supplementals. In this mode the decoder returns the decoded value of the main block right away if it does not belong to one of the following supplemental types: 378, 379, 977, 978, 979, 414, 419, 434 or 439. If the barcode starts with one of the prefixes it searches the image more aggressively for a supplemental. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main barcode is returned.
	* **Supplemental 378-379 -** Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 378 or 379. Disables reading of supplementals for any other UPC/EAN barcode not starting with 378 or 379. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main barcode is returned.
	* **Supplemental 978-979 -** Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 978 or 979. Disables reading of supplementals for another UPC/EAN barcode not starting with 978 or 979. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main barcode is returned.
	* **Supplemental 414-419-434-439 -** Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 414, 419, 434 or 439. Disables reading of supplementals for another UPC/EAN barcode not starting with 414, 419, 434 or 439. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main barcode is returned.
	* **Supplemental 977 -** Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 977. Disables reading of supplementals for another UPC/EAN barcode not starting with 977. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main barcode is returned.

* **Retry Count -** Retry count for auto-discriminating for supplementals. Possible values are from 2-20. Note that this flag is only considered if Supplemental Mode - UPC EAN is set to one of the following values: Supplementals Auto, Supplementals Smart, Supplementals 378-379, Supplementals 978-979, Supplementals 977 or Supplementals 414-419-434-439 (2 to 20).

	* Security All Twice - Two times read redundancy for all barcodes.
	* Security Long and Short - Two times read redundancy for long barcodes, three times for short barcodes.
	* Security All Thrice - Three times read redundancy for all barcodes.

* **Picklist -** Allows the imager to decode only the barcode that is directly under the cross-hair/reticle (+) part of the pattern. This feature is useful in applications where multiple barcodes may appear in the field of view during a decode session and only one of them is targeted for decode.
	* Disable - Disables Picklist mode. Any barcode within the field of view can be decoded.
	* Enable (Centered) - Enables the Picklist mode so that only the barcode in the center of the image is decoded. This is most useful when used in conjunction with the static and dynamic reticle viewfinder modes. Note: This mode is only valid for decoder modules that supports a viewfinder. Attempting to set this for an unsupported decoder will result in an error (camera scanner only).
	* Enable (Reticle) - Enables the Picklist mode so that only the barcode that is directly under the cross-hair (reticle) is decoded. This is useful when used in conjunction with the static and dynamic reticle viewfinder modes (scan module only)

* **Aim Type -** Type Trigger Modes
	* Trigger - For each trigger press, a single barcode can be scanned.
	* Timed Hold – Once trigger is pressed, an aiming session is started for a time specified by Aim Timer. When this time expires, a decode session is started and scan beam will be visible. The decode session will remain active until the Beam Timer expires, the trigger is released or a barcode is decoded.
	* Timed Release - Once the trigger is pressed, an aiming session is started and will continue until the trigger is released. If the Aim Timer is expired when the trigger is released, a decode session will be started with scan beam visible for a remaining time equal to the Beam Timer or until a barcode is decoded.
	* Press and Release - The scan beam starts when the trigger is pressed and released. The decode session will remain active until the Beam Timer expires or a barcode is decoded.
	* Continuous Read - A press and hold of the scan trigger will continuously scan barcodes. Not supported with the Zebra RS507 Bluetooth Ring Scanner.
	* Press and Sustain - Continue the decode session until the Beam Timer is expired, barcode is decoded or read is canceled. This avoids unexpected cancellations of a read by subsequently pressing the trigger button of the device. If the trigger button of the device is pressed while the beam is ON, it has no effect. 

* **Aim Timer -** Sets the duration (in ms) for timed aim modes. Supports values from 0-60000, in steps of 100 (i.e. 0, 100, 200, 300...). 

* **Same Symbol Timeout -** Suppress decoding the same symbol within the specified time interval (in ms) while in Continuous Trigger Mode. Supports values from 0-5000, in steps of 500 (i.e. 0, 500, 1000, 1500...). 

* **Different Symbol Timeout -** Suppress decoding an additional symbol within the specified time interval (in ms) while in Continuous Trigger Mode. Supports values from 0-5000 in steps of 500 (i.e. 0, 500, 1000, 1500...).

* **Illumination mode -** Enable/Disable illumination depending on ambient light conditions.

* **Keep pairing info after reboot -** Enable/Disable automatic reconnection after scanner reboot. Applies to DS3678 Bluetooth scanner only.

	* Enable - Enables LCD mode

**Note: When using the LCD mode**, a degradation in performance might be observed and the aiming crosshair might blink until the barcode is decoded.

* HW Engine Low Power Timeout - Timeout value (in ms) for the scanner engine to enter Low Power mode. Supports values from 0-1000 in steps of 50 (i.e. 0, 50, 100, 150...). 

* Time Delay to Low Power - Time delay for scanner to enter low power mode
	* 1 Second
	* 30 Seconds
	* 1 Minute
	* 5 Minutes

* **Illumination Brightness Value -** Illumination Brightness of the Imager

* **Inverse 1D Mode -** This parameter allows the user to select decoding on inverse 1D barcodes.

### Multi-barcode Notes

**Picklist Behavior -** In multi-barcode scanning mode, when a picklist reader parameter is set to a value other than “Disabled," the user is expected to move the crosshair to the specified number of barcodes to be scanned. Set this value (from 2-10) using the `BarcodeCount` parameter. **Data is returned only after the specified number of barcodes is read**. 

**Decoding with duplicate barcodes -** If a label to be scanned contains multiple barcodes, some of which are duplicates (with the same data and label type), only one barcode from the duplicates will be decoded; the remainder are ignored. If the label has two duplicate barcodes plus another two different barcodes, a maximum of three barcodes will be decoded and one will be ignored as a duplicate.

**Decoding behavior with number of barcodes -** Barcodes can be of multiple label types. If the required number of barcodes (from 1-10, as set using the `BarcodeCount` parameter) is not in view of the scanner, the scanner will not decode any data. If the scanner's field of view contains a number of barcodes greater than the value set by `BarcodeCount`, the scanner will randomly decode any barcode(s) until the count is reached. For example, if the count is set to two and eight barcodes are in the field of view, the scanner will return data for the first two barcodes it sees, and return the data in random order.

## Scan Params

Allows the configuration of Code Id and decode feedback options.

* **Code ID Type -** A Code ID character identifies the code type of a scanned barcode. This is useful when the reader is decoding more than one code type. Select a code ID character to insert between the prefix and the decoded symbol.
	* Code ID Type None - No prefix (default).
	* Code ID Type Aim - A standards based three character prefix.
	* Code ID Type Symbol - A Symbol defined single character prefix.

**Note: Not all ringtones are fully supported as decode tones**. Ringtones of longer length may be truncated when used as a decode tone. Zebra recommends testing the selected tone(s) for desired operation before deployment.

* **Beep Volume Channel -**
	* Ringer
	* Music and Media
	* Alarms
	* Notification

* **Decode Audio Feedback -** Select an audio tone to sound upon a good decode.
	* The audio tones stored as Application’s private data (i.e. cache, asset) should not be specified for this field to avoid access violation. Therefore any audio tones meant for this purpose must be stored under shared public directories (i.e. /Music, /Ringtones, etc.) or in shared external storage.

* **Decode Haptic Feedback -** Enable the MC40 to vibrate upon a good decode.

* **BT Disconnect On Exit -** Enable/Disable Bluetooth disconnect on exit.

* **Connection Idle Time -** If a Bluetooth-scanner associated application is opened, the Bluetooth scanner will be automatically disconnected after this Connection Time duration of inactivity. From 60 to 1800, Steps of 5. Eg: 60, 65, 70, 75...

* **Establish Connection Time -** Time (from 30-60 seconds) that the `enable` method will be blocked before returning if a Bluetooth scanner connection is not established.

* **Display BT Address Barcode -** If this value is set to true, the Bluetooth Pairing Utility Application will be opened when the enable method is called.

* **Decode Feedback LED Timer -** Defines the length of time (in ms) to flash the Green LED to indicate a successful decode.

**Decoding LED Notification -** When enabled, causes the Red LED to flash when the scan trigger is pressed.

* **Engine Decode LED -** Controls Engines' decode LED behavior
	* Disabled
	* Off on power down
	* Power down only after LED off

-----

## UDI Params

* **Enable UDI-GS1 -** Enable/Disable GS1 format decoding.

* **Enable UDI-HIBCC -** Enable/Disable HIBCC format decoding.

* **Enable UDI-ICCBBA -** Enable/Disable ICCBBA format decoding.

-----

## Multi-barcode Params

* **Barcode count -** Number of barcodes (from 2-10) to decode.

-----

## Output Data

For an application to receive barcode data, one or more Output Features must be specified. See individual reference documentation for more information:
