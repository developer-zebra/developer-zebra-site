##Overview

This sample demonstrates how to write a Kotlin application to consume Zebra’s EMDK for Android library. It's a proof of concept based on the [EMDK Barcode Sample 1​](../barcode/) (the important file is `MainActivity.kt​`).  This fork can be built with Android Studio 3.x and run on any Zebra mobile computer supported by EMDK 6.9.

> See "Downloads" and "Sources" buttons above for more information. <br> See the Zebra Developer Portal for the original [Kotlin Project Description](https://developer.zebra.com/blog/kotlin-and-developing-kotlin-applications-zebra-devices)
