### EMDK Downloads

EMDK for Xamarin 3.0 was the first version to fully support the Microsoft NuGet package management system. However, Zebra by special request added NuGet support to EMDK-X versions 2.6 and 2.7. For access to those versions, use the appropriate link below. 

* EMDK-X 2.6 or 2.7 with NuGet support | [Zebra EMDK for Xamarin page](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/developer-tools/emdk-for-xamarin.html)
