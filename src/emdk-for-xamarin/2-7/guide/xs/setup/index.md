##Installing the Most Recent Add-in
This section describes how to keep your development environment up to date with the most recent version of the EMDK For Xamarin. By choosing this method, you will receive update notifications when a new version is published. If you wish to install a specific version of EMDK for Xamarin, please see the `Installing A Previous Add-in Version` section below.

Before Installing this Add-in make sure your Xamarin Studio version is at least 5.9.5 or above.

>Note: Xamarin Studio is no longer available for Windows. Visual Studio is recommended for EMDK for Xamarin development on Windows.

1. Open Xamarin Studio Add-in Manager by selecting Xamarin Studio Menu > Add-in Manager
2. Then select the Gallery Tab 
3. Enter `emdk` in the search box in the top right corner of the Add-in Manager.
