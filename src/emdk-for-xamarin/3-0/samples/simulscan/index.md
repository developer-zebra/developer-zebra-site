##Overview
This sample application will show how the Simulscan API's can be used to capture multiple types of data from forms, boxes and the like.

##Prerequisites

You will need:

* A SimulScan licensed device
* A Simulscan template
* A printed copy of the form used to create the template


##Requirements
Android API 19 must be installed via the SDK Manager before attempting to load this sample.


##Loading the Sample Application

1. Choose a sample and click the **See Details** button.
2. Now click the **Download** button 
3. Extract the downloaded project zip file.
4. Navigate to the root of the unzipped project folder and double-click the **.sln** file. The project will load in the default IDE for that file type.

Alternatively, you can Launch your prefered IDE ( Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio ) and load the project via the File > Open menu.  


##Using This Sample

1. Place a template on the sdcard of you SimulScan licensed device.

		:::
		adb push myTemplate.xml /sdcard/simulscan/templates/
	

2. Launch The SimulScan sample application
	
	The Simulscan sample app will find the templates you place on the devices sdcard, and populate the "Set Template" option list.  Select the template you wish to use from that list.
