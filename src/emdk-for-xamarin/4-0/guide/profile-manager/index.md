Profile Manager is an exclusive EMDK technology offered within your IDE, providing a GUI based development tool. This allows you to write fewer lines of code resulting in reduced development time, effort and errors.  

###Accessing the Profile Manager
1. Inside your IDE, select an open Xamarin.Android project.

	NOTE: Profile manager will create a profile xml file and add it to your project. Selecting and open project will tell profile manager which project you want the profile added to. 

2. Select "EMDK" -> "Profile Manager" on the tool bar.

##Using the Profile Manager API
Once you create your profiles using the Profile Manager, they will be bundled with your application and available to access using the [Profile Manager APIs](/emdk-for-xamarin/3-0/api/). These profiles will NOT be applied on the device until it is processed using these APIs.

### Multiple Ways to Access
In the ProfileManager API, you will see methods for `ProcessProfile` and `ProcessProfileAsync`. Essentially the last parameter, `extraData`, is one of two types:

* **Document** - data will be handled as a XML Document.
* **String** - data will be handled as a raw string.

###Creating or Activating a Profile
A profile is created or activated with using the PROFILE_FLAG.SET option. If the profileFlag is set to SET, and if the given profile is not available, it will look for a valid profile in the extraData argument and if present, the profile  will be added to the internal XML volatile repository and also applied to the device.  If the profile is present, then it will be applied to the device.

	:::csharp
    // Call processPrfoileAsync with profile name, 'Set' flag and modify data to update the profile
    EMDKResults results = profileManager.ProcessProfileAsync(profileName, ProfileManager.PROFILE_FLAG.Set, modifyData);
  


## Usage Notes
### Get Started with a Tutorial
Be sure to follow step by step instructions for using the Profile Manager and the associated API's in the [Getting Started Tutorial](/emdk-for-xamarin/3-0/tutorial/helloxamarin)

### Multiple Instance of Features
There should only be one instance of the DataCapture feature. The EMDK Profile Manager will not allow you to add multiple DataCapture features, but may happen if you are manually editing the EMDKConfig.xml. Other profile features can have multiple instances and may be required in some cases. For example, you may need two 'Certificate Manager' features. The first one to initialize the certificate store and the second one to install a new certificate.

### Order of Features
The profile features will be applied synchronously in the order they appear. For example, you may want to set the clock before you attempt to connect to a Wi-Fi network.

### extraData as XML String
The processProfile method has an overload method that allows sending XML content in the `extraData` parameter as a String.  

Method Signature:

	:::csharp
	// Pass in a string in XML form
	ProcessProfileAsync(String profileName, ProfileManager.PROFILE_FLAG profileFlag, String[] extraData)

`profileName` can be:

1. `[Name of Profile]` - to reference the entire profile. ex: 'EMDKProfile1'
2. `[profileName]/[featureType]/[feature friendly name in profile parameters]` to just edit part of the profile. For example, if my profile is called 'Profile1' and the name I gave to the Clock feature is 'ckEST'. Passing 'profileName' as 'Profile1/Clock/ckEST' will just process this part of the profile.
	* Valid `[featureType]`:	ActivitySelection, Barcode, MSR, Intent, Keystroke, IP, Clock, PowerMgr, PersistMgr, CertMgr, AppMgr, AccessMgr, Wi-Fi, GprsMgr

#### XML String Structure
One way you can see how this XML string should be structured is to use the Profile Manager and inspect the XML file that is created:

1. Open any project in either Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio that does not have a EMDK profile defined already (so you get just the parameters you want to change).
2. Select EMDK / Profile Manager from the menu.
3. Add the Profile features you want and selection the options you wish to use.
4. Click Finish when you are done with your selections.
5. Look in the `assets` folder and open `EMDKConfig.xml`
6. Notice the XML structure that is shown. This complete structure is to be passed in the extraData parameter as a string. You can choose to copy and paste this into your code to be used.

> WARNING!: XML parm names and values may not be the same as what is presented in the Profile Manager wizard. Pay close attention to the fields of interest. It is not recommended to manually edit this XML, use the Profile Manager Wizard to ensure proper formation of the XML structure and values.

#### Profile Name Usage Notes
If the ProfileName node is given in extraData and the ProfileFlag is SET, ProfileName in ExtraData should match with the first parameter passed to processProfile.

Example:

	:::csharp
	string[] extraData = new string[1];
	extraData[0]=
	"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>" +
	"<characteristic type=\"Profile\">" +
	"<parm name=\"ProfileName\" value=\" EMDKProfile1\"/>" +
	"<characteristic type=\"Clock\">" +
	"<parm name=\"emdk_name\" value=\"ck1\"/>" +
	"<parm name=\"Date\" value=\"2013-05-23\" />" +
	"<parm name=\"Time\" value=\"6:59:00\" />" +
	"<parm name=\"TimeZone\" value=\"America/Los_Angeles\" />" +
	"</characteristic>"+
	"</characteristic>";

	emdkStatus = mProfileManager.ProcessProfileAsync("EMDKProfile1", ProfileManager.PROFILE_FLAG.SET, extraData);

* If the ProfileName node is NOT given in extraData and the ProfileFlag is SET, the content will be merged with the profile given in the first parameter passed to processProfile.

* If the ProfileFlag is SET and the profile given in the first parameter passed to processProfile does not exist in EMDKConfig.xml, the profile will be appended to the internal repository.

* DataCapture content (Activity Selection, Barcode, MSR, Intent, Keystroke, IP) is considered as a whole and setting any individual feature will set as a whole. In other words, setting "EmdkSampleProfile-1/Keystroke" will push all the DataCapture features to the device.

#### Feature Name Usage Notes
Each specific profile feature can be named so that only that portion of the profile can be referenced. This can be accomplished by:

1. Specifying a name for the specific feature within a profile.
2. Using the fully qualified name as the first parameter of the processProfile method.

* If the ProfileFlag is SET, the emdk_name given in ExtraData should match the third part of the profileName passed to the processProfile method (first parameter).

In the following example, we created a profile called `EMDKProfile1` and added the Clock feature with a name of `ck2`. Now we can modify that profile using the processProfile method, making sure we specify the `emdk_name` parameter as `ck2` and use a profileName of `EMDKProfile1/Clock/ck2` in the processProfile method:

	:::csharp
	string[] extraData = new string[1];
	extraData[0]=
	"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>" +
	"<characteristic type=\"Profile\">" +
	"<parm name=\"ProfileName\" value=\" EMDKProfile1\"/>" +
	"<characteristic type=\"Clock\">" +
	"<parm name=\"emdk_name\" value=\"ck2\"/>" +
	"<parm name=\"Date\" value=\"2013-05-23\" />" +
	"<parm name=\"Time\" value=\"6:59:00\" />" +
	"<parm name=\"TimeZone\" value=\"America/Los_Angeles\" />" +
	"</characteristic>"+
	"</characteristic>";

	emdkStatus = mProfileManager.ProcessProfileAsync("EMDKProfile1/Clock/ck2", ProfileManager.PROFILE_FLAG.SET, extraData);

* If the ProfileFlag is SET, the emdk_name is NOT given in ExtraData and if the first parameter passed to processProfileis has the fully qualified name (ex: EMDKProfile1/Clock/ck2) , content will be appended to the profile (this only applicable for non-DataCapture features).

Example:  

	:::csharp
	string[] extraData = new string[1];
	extraData[0]=
	"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>" +
	"<characteristic type=\"Profile\">" +
	"<parm name=\"ProfileName\" value=\" EMDKProfile1\"/>" +
	"<characteristic type=\"Clock\">" +
	"<parm name=\"Date\" value=\"2013-05-23\" />" +
	"<parm name=\"Time\" value=\"6:59:00\" />" +
	"<parm name=\"TimeZone\" value=\"America/Los_Angeles\" />" +
	"</characteristic>"+
	"</characteristic>";

	emdkStatus = mProfileManager.ProcessProfile("EMDKProfile1/Clock", ProfileManager.PROFILE_FLAG.SET, extraData);

#### PROFILE_FLAG.SET Usage Summary
