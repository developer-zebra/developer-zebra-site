##Prerequisites

**Items Needed**
* One of the approved devices listed above
* TC7X SNAP On DEX cable ( CBL-TC7X-DEX1-01 )

>Note: Although this sample may work with previous versions of the EMDK, it is advised to [update the EMDK runtime](../../guide/setupDevice/) on your device before loading this sample.

##Loading the Sample Application

1. Choose a sample and click the **See Details** button.
2. Now click the **Download** button 
3. `IMPORTANT:` **Extract the downloaded project zip file <u>to C:\</u>** (or to the **root** of an alternate drive).
