## Overview

The Zebra Enterprise Mobility Management Toolkit (EMM TK) is designed to allow developers of EMM/MDM solutions to adapt their products to manage Zebra devices and software. This primarily involves interfacing with the [MX Management System (MXMS)](/mx/overview), an XML-based communication framework for managing the capabilities and behaviors of Zebra Android devices. Through this mechanism, an EMM solution provider can offer customers the option of bringing Zebra devices under management using its solution. 

**Zebra staging mechanisms follow these basic processes**:​

* **Generate a barcode** or other medium that contains staging instructions​
* **Read the generated medium on the device** using a staging client
* **Execute the staging instructions to**:​
 * Configure the device for connection to a staging network​
 * Download, install, configure and launch an EMM Agent on the device​
 * Perform persistence and/or other desired staging tasks

DO WE WANT TO GO HERE: 
Prior solutions required two separate sets of tools: One to generate the XML-based profiles for consumption by a client on the device, and another to 

and read them on the device for configuring Zebra devices, and another --could export those profiles for deployment through an EMM. Zebra is phasing out the two-tool solution in favor of informing EMM solution providers how to modify their tools to generate the XML. 


In essence, 

This Toolkit provides a sample application and the following guide to walk through the common tasks and components that you will use in order for your MDM client to interface with the MXMS (MX Management System) available on Zebra Android devices. This Toolkit does not provide the means to generate XML required to exchange data with the MXMS. XML should be generated by utilizing the "Export a Profile to an MDM" feature of StageNow 2.3. XML, once generated, should be passed into the MDM client via some transport mechanism, processed on the client by submission to the MXMS and then the resulting XML response from MXMS should be passed back out of the client for processing. The MXMS XML response will contain data as to whether the submitted XML processed successfully, or failed due to errors in XML syntax or requested operation.





### Entitlement Criteria
put this here? 

To work with StageNow and consume XML for the MX management layer

To persist an agent and/or service on the device following an enterprise reset.
