## Overview

This guide is intended for EMM vendors and other Zebra partners that offer solutions designed to administer and manage Zebra devices in an enterprise. It describes the timeline for changes to the systems and mechanisms by which Zebra devices are managed. 

<!-- 
**_after_** they've been brought under management by an EMM system. 

 -->

Administrative mechanisms and processes generally include:​

* An EMM administrator that uses an EMM Console to request that some administrative task be performed to a selected set of managed devices​.
* The EMM server transmits a command in an EMM-defined command format to the EMM agent on each affected device via an EMM-defined protocol​.
* The EMM agent on each affected device receives the command, decodes the command and uses a suitable admin mechanism on the Zebra device to produce the required effect for the requested administrative task​.
