## Overview

This document describes features permitted in Schemas defined by the Android Managed Configuration Model that OemConfig applications such as Zebra OemConfig are permitted to use, and that non-OemConfig applications are not. This is important because an EMM can be coded to handle only Managed Configuration Schemas that conform to the more restrictive subset of Schema capabilities imposed when uploading non-OemConfig applications to the Google Play Store. In such cases, an EMM is unable to properly handle an OemConfig Schema without enhancement. This document describes the sorts of additional features that might be required, and provides some examples of how a data-driven UI might be designed to handle these features.
