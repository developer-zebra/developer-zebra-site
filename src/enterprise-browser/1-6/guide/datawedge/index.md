title: Using DataWedge with EB
productversion: '1.6'
product: Enterprise Browser
layout: guide.html
---
##Overview 

The DataWedge app (included on every Zebra device) makes it possible to fetch barcode data from within an Enterprise Browser application without using the Enterprise Browser APIs. This guide explains how to configure an EB app to scan and acquire barcode data using DataWedge, which then enters the captured data as keystrokes into any EB input field. 

**Important: Control of barcode scanning hardware is exclusive**. When DataWedge is active, the Enterprise Browser Barcode APIs will be inoperable. Likewise, an Enterprise Browser app that uses Barcode APIs will prevent other apps (including DataWedge) from accessing the scanner. This guide explains how to take control of a device's scanner hardware and how to subsequently release it to other apps.

2. Select **Menu->Settings**.
3. Uncheck **DataWedge enabled** checkbox.
4. For scanning to be enabled, the below runtime configuration tag must be set to 0:
    * **The [&lt;usedwforscanning&gt;](../configreference/index.md#usedwforscanning) tag in the EB app's** `config.xml` **file must contain a value of "0"**.
	
####Create DataWedge Profile:
1. Install Enterprise Browser application.
2. Start DataWedge application.
3. Select **Menu->New profile** and **Enter profile name** and press **OK**.
4. Click on newly created profile from the **DataWedge Profiles** list.
5. Click on **Associated apps** in the **Applications** section.

##Guidelines for DataWedge Version - Between 2.2.9 to 5.1.13
Below explains what to be done when scanning is required within Enterprise Browser application either using DataWedge application or Enterprise Browser Barcode API.

###Use DataWedge for Scanning
1. **Click the link below** to download the required **DataWedge (`.db`)** profiles: 
    * [Download RhoElements Profile](https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra_new_ia/en-us/software/developer-tools/enterprise-browser/dwprofile_RhoElements.db)
    * [Download EnterpriseBrowser Profile](https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra_new_ia/en-us/software/developer-tools/enterprise-browser/dwprofile_EnterpriseBrowser.db)
2. **Copy both profiles to the device** into the **`/Android/data/com.symbol.datawedge/files`** directory, replacing the existing file (if any). 
3. On the device, Install the **Enterprise Browser** application that will be using **DataWedge** (if not already installed). 
4. **Start DataWedge** on the device. 
5. In **DataWedge**, select **Menu->Settings->Import Profile**.  A list of available profiles appears ([as shown on this example screen](../../../../datawedge/5-0/guide/advanced#importaprofile)).
6. From the list, **tap the profiles in order which were copied in Step 2**. When the profiles are imported, focus returns to the previous screen and a confirmation message appears. 
7. **Tap** the **BACK** button to return to the **DataWedge** profiles list. Both **RhoElements** and **EnterpriseBrowser** profiles are listed and the **EnterpriseBrowser** profile will be enabled by default. 
8. For scanning to be enabled, the below runtime configuration tag must be set to 1:
    * **The [&lt;usedwforscanning&gt;](../configreference/index.md#usedwforscanning) tag in the EB app's** `config.xml` **file must contain a value of "1"**.
