## Installation  

### Set up a Local Web Server on the Device  
The Feature Demo Application for Enterprise Browser pulls in demo files using uses `AJAX`, which requires a web server to be running on the device. 

**Enable the on-device web server**:

&#49;. Locate the `Config.xml` file on the device that will be running the Feature Demo: 

**Path to Config.xml file**: 
  * **On Android devices**: `/sdcard/Android/data/com.symbol.enterprisebrowser/Config.xml`
  * **On Windows devices**: `\Program Files\EnterpriseBrowser\Config\Config.xml`

&#50;. Add the following lines to the `Config.xml` immediately under the `<Configuration>` tag, as below:

      
    :::xml
    <Configuration>
      <WebServer>
    	 <Enabled value="1" />
    	 <Port value="8082" />
    	 <WebFolder value="/fd/" />
    	 <Public value="1" />
      </WebServer>


&#51;. In `Config.xml` specify the start page value as below:  
		
		:::HTML

	    <StartPage value="http://127.0.0.1:8082/feature-demo.html" name="Menu"/>

&#52;. Create a folder called `fd` (case sensitive) in the root of the device's SDCard. If it doesn't have an SDCard, create the folder at the root level of the device's internal memory.  

&#53;. From the computer with Enterprise Browser installed, copy the contents of `c:/EnterpriseBrowser/Feature-Demo` to the newly created `fd` folder.

## Troubleshooting  
Still having trouble getting the Feature Demo to work? Try the following:  

* Check that the device has the latest available BSP from the [Zebra Support Portal](https://www.zebra.com/enterprisesupport).

* Confirm that DataWedge is configured correctly. See the [DataWedge documentation](/datawedge/5-0/guide/about/) and the device's [Integrator Guide](https://www.zebra.com/enterprisesupport) for more information.

* If the device won't display the Feature Demo application screen, double-check that the &lt;StartPage&gt; parameter in the `Config.xml` contains the correct path to the start page.

* Check the Settings panel on the device to ensure that Wi-Fi is enabled and connected.
