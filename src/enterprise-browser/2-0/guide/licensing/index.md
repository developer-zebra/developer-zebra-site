productversion: '2.0'
product: Enterprise Browser

---

## Overview 
**Beginning with Enterprise Browser 2.0, the process for applying device licenses has changed. <u>Upgrading to EB 2.0 requires that all licenses be converted to the new model**</u>. Licensed apps running on EB 1.8 (and older) are unaffected; existing licenses remain valid. 

Commercial deployment to devices requires an End-User License (**also known as an "Activation ID"** or AID) issued by Zebra Technologies for each device. Licenses are available for 90-day trial and perpetual functionality. Both license types permit an unlimited number of Enterprise Browser-based apps to run on the device(s). This guide explains the process of obtaining an Enterprise Browser license for commercial use and applying the license to individual devices and as part of a mass-deployment. A given license key can be activated on any number of devices up to the total quantity of licenses purchased as explained below. 

### Requirements
* **One or more license keys** (aka Activation IDs) purchased for EB 2.0 software
* **Zebra device(s) with License Manager app** on device:
 * **Android**: License Manager 3.1.1 or higher (pre-installed on supported devices)
 * **Windows Mobile/CE**: License Manager 1.0 or higher (included with EB installer)
* **Internet connection** (for online activation) **OR**
* **Linux or Windows server** (for off-line activation) 

-----

## I. Contact a Reseller 
The first step in obtaining a license is to engage with Zebra or a Zebra reseller. 

**&#49;. [Visit Zebra's Enterprise Browser Product Page](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/software/mobile-computers/mobile-app-utilities/enterprise-browser.html)** and select one of the methods for contacting Zebra directly or engaging with a reseller or partner. 

**&#50;. Alternatively, select one of the following Zebra resources**: 

* **[Find a Zebra Partner](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/partners/find-a-zebra-partner.html) -** form for submitting an inquiry via the web
* **[How to Select a Channel Partner](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/partners/find-a-zebra-partner/selecting-the-right-channel-partner.html) -** explains the types of partners that engage with Zebra and some of their technologies and specialties
* **[Partner Interaction Center](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/partners/partner-interaction-center.html) -** info for contacting Zebra's existing global partner network

-----

## II. Access Licensing System
After a licensing agreement is purchased from Zebra or a Zebra reseller, an email is sent to the licensing company's representative containing user credentials for accessing the Zebra Enterprise Software Licensing system (**also new starting with EB 2.0**). 

* **Visit the [Zebra licensing support page](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software-licensing.html), register and log into the portal to:** 
	* Place an order for licenses
	* See the status of existing orders
	* Assign licenses to devices or deployments
	* View current license inventory and assignments
<!-- https://zebra-licensing.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/logon.do -->
-----

## III. Manually Assign License
This section describes the process for activating a license on a single device running Android. To manually activate a license on a device running Windows Moblie/CE, see the [Windows Mobile/CE section](#windowsmobilecedevices). To remotely activate multiple licenses for an entire organization, see the [Mass Deployment section](#massdeployment) of this guide. 

#### License Source Types
* **Cloud-based server** (internet connection required)
* **Local server** (on customer premises)
<!-- available only under special circumstances
* **Pre-activated** (binary file pushed to device) 
 -->

#### Connectivity Options
* **Production Cloud Direct -** License Manager maps automatically to web-based Zebra Licensing Server to activate licenses; no server configuration required.
* **Production Cloud Through Proxy -** License Manager maps automatically to web-based Zebra Licensing Server through customer's on-premise proxy server. Requires configuration of proxy server settings. 
* Custom Cloud - **Reserved for future use**. <!-- If a custom or relay server is used to manage licensing, a unique URL and server name can be added as a separate license source to appear in future source lists.   -->
* Test Cloud Direct - **For Zebra internal use only**.
* Test Cloud Through Proxy - **For Zebra internal use only**.

#### BEFORE BEGINNING
* **Confirm that the clock is set correctly on the device to ensure proper license-application behavior**. 
* **License-key barcodes are not provided by Zebra**; they can be created by the licensee to ease the activation process. Keys also can be typed in manually. 
<!-- * License sources added using this process are subsequently available for selection in the "Select License Source" drop down list.
 -->
**To activate a device license**:  

1. Locate and **launch the License Manager** app:
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="eb20_licensemgrapp.png"/>
<br>
2. On launch, License Manager displays active licenses (if any).<br> 
**Tap the floating action button**:
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="license_manager_splash.png"/>
<br>

<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="7.png"/>
<br>

#### The Android device is now licensed to use Enterprise Browser 2.0. 

-----

### Windows Mobile/CE Devices
Zebra provides License Manager apps for its devices running Android and Windows Mobile/CE. **License Manager 1.0 (or higher) is required for licensing Windows Mobile/CE devices**, and is included with the Microsoft Installer (MSI) file (when installing from Windows) and as a `.CAB` file when installing from macOS. 

> `IMPORTANT:` **Zebra recommends using StageNow to generate XML files** required for this process. [Download StageNow](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/utilities/stagenow.html); it's free. 

**To activate a license on a device running Windows Mobile/CE**: 

1. **Push the XML file** required for license activation to the device. 
2. Locate and launch License Manager on the device. <br>
Current licenses on the device (if any) are shown along with a series of buttons: 
<img alt="" style="height:250px" src="wmce_license01.png"/>
**Details -** displays information about selected license.<br>
**Refresh -** contacts the licensing server to renew a device license following the purchase of a license renewal.<br>
**Button functions**:<br>
**Return -** relinquishes the selected license.<br> 
**Add License -** begins the license activation process.<br>
**Settings -** displays the License Manager Settings panel.<br>
3. **Tap "Add License"** button. "About License Manager" screen appears.<br>
**Tap "License Source"** button.   
<img alt="" style="height:250px" src="wmce_license02.png"/>
<br>
4. **Select "Production Cloud Direct"** from the server list. 
<img alt="" style="height:250px" src="wmce_license03.png"/>
**Details -** displays information about the selected licensing server.<br>
**Delete -** removes a user-defined licensing server (none shown).<br> 
5. **Using an EMM system, launch License Manager with command line arguments** similar to those shown. This example was tested using SOTI Mobi control. 

		:::xml
		// for XML file in root directory of device: 
		start "\Program Files\LicenseManager\LicenseManager.exe" activate license.xml

		// for XML file in a specific License Manager folder on device:  
		start "\Program Files\LicenseManager\LicenseManager.exe" activate \Program Files\LicenseManager\license.xml 
<br>

6. Following the operation, a `Result.xml` file is placed in the same location as the source XML file. 

#### Example
The following XML file selects the cloud-based Zebra Licensing Server as the license source.  

	:::xml
	<wap-provisioningdoc>
		<characteristic type="LicenseMgr" version="8.1" >
			<parm name="LicenseChoice" value="zebra"/>
		<characteristic type="LicenseZebra">
			<parm name="LicenseActionZebra" value="activate"/>
		<characteristic type="NewLicenseZebra">
		<characteristic type="LicenseSourceURL">
			<parm name="LicenseSource" value="Zebra Cloud"/>
			<parm name="LicenseCloudURL" value="2"/>
		</characteristic>
			<parm name="ActivationID" value="0e62-2e66-53ec-4619-86bb-5246-ce58-24d5"/>
			<parm name="ActivationQuantity" value="1"/>
		</characteristic>
		</characteristic>
		</characteristic>
	</wap-provisioningdoc>

<!-- 
#### Activation Using Shortcuts
An EMM system admin deploy use a Windows Mobile/CE shortcut (`.lnk`) file to launch License Manager and activate a license on a device. This can help simplify mass deployment of licenses across an enterprise. 

Shortcuts can be created (using License Manager command line arguments) and pushed to the `WINDOWS/Start Menu`. The License Manager shortcut appears after rebooting the device. Launching License Manager from the shortcut also can execute License Manager with given command line arguments. An example of this process is shown below. 

**To interact with a license server using a shortcut**: 

1. Create an activation XML file called `license.xml`. 
2. Push `license.xml` to the root directory of the device.
3. Create a shortcut called `test.lnk` using the content below: 

		:::xml
		71#"\Program Files\LicenseManager\LicenseManager.exe" activate license.xml
<br>
Above content says to create a shortcut of LicenseManger.exe and to pass below command line arguments

activate license.xml

Push the test.lnk file to WINDOWS/Start Menu
Reboot the device to see the licensemanager shortcut
Launch the shortcut to execute the command line argument and see the result.xml at root directory.

 -->
-----

## Off-line Licensing
License Manager provides a Local License Server option, enabling organizations to employ an on-premise server to distribute licenses to devices without access to the internet. This option requires software installed on a company's own IP-based Linux or Windows server in advance of license distribution to devices. 

For more information, including hardware requirements and setup instructions, refer to the [Local License Server Administration Guide (.pdf)](local-licenses-server-ag-en.pdf). 

**To License from a Local Server**: 

1. **Tap Local Server** from the License Source drop-down.<br> 
A screen appears as below.
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="local_server.png"/>
<br>
2. **Enter the server URL, provide a name and tap SUBMIT**.   
3. **Enter or scan the license key for the device**. <br>
Then **Tap Activate**. 
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="6a.png"/>
<br>

Successful license activation is indicated by a screen similar to the image below: 
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="7.png"/>
<br>

#### The device is now licensed to use Enterprise Browser 2.0. 

-----

## Mass Deployment 

Mass-deployment of Enterprise Browser device licenses requires use of an Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) system and/or Zebra StageNow tools and its [License Manager Setting Type](/stagenow/latest/csp/license).

**IMPORTANT**: The procedures described below include only those for deploying and activating licenses for EB 2.0 (or later). They **DO NOT** include the purchase process for license activation IDs nor configuration of the network and device clock settings, which are required to download the app and properly apply the license(s).

### Prerequisites

* Profiles for correctly configuring device clock and network settings
* Software License key(s) (aka Activation IDs)
* All necessary EB 2.0 application (binary) files

> **Zebra recommends testing any new Profile on a working device before general deployment**.

-----

**To create the licensing portion of a StageNow Profile**:

1. **Launch StageNow and select “Create new Profile"** from the left-hand pane. <br>
The "Select a Wizard" dialog box appears.
2. **Select MX version to match device**, click "Xpert Mode" and click the "Create" button.
3. **Enter a Profile name and click "Start"** button.
4. **Single-click LicenseMgr** (scroll down if necessary); then **click "Update"** button. 
5. **Under "License action type:" select “Perform Zebra license action.”** Additional options appear: 
<img alt="" style="height:450px" src="stagenow_licenseMgr.png"/>
_Click image to enlarge_.
<br>
6. **Set the parameters as required** to activate the license:<br>
 **a. For cloud-based licensing**: <br>
 	**Zebra recommends this option for the best device visibility from the licensing portal**:<br>
	* **Zebra license action**: Activate AID -> select "Use one of the Zebra Licensing cloud options"<br>
	* **Cloud Source**: "Use the Zebra licensing Production Cloud" <br>
	* Enter the AID and quantity. **Select "Continue"**.<br>

 **b. For local (on-premise) licensing**:<br>
 	**Best for fire-walled networks or those lacking internet access**:  
	* **Zebra license action**: Activate AID -> select "Use a local license server option"<br>
	* **Enter the URL, friendly name, AID and quantity** 
	* **Select Continue**.  
7. **Complete Profile creation and scan the staging barcode**.
8. **Confirm that the Profile successfully licensed the device**: <br>
 a. **Launch the License Manager app** on the device; activated license should be visible.<br>
 b. Alternatively, launch EB 2.0 on the device. The splash screen indicates licensing status. <br>
 c. The quantity of available licenses visible on the licensing portal should decrease by the number of licenses deployed. A list of device IDs also is visible there.<br>

Also see [related guides](#relatedguides). 

-----

## License Transfer
Enterprise Browser supports the transfer of licenses from one device to another if the device licenses were originally activated using a cloud-based or local licensing server. This is accomplished by returning the activated license(s) to the pool (using License Action "Return") and activating them on new device(s).

See the [License Manager section](/stagenow/latest/csp/license) of Zebra's StageNow tool for details.

-----

## Logging

**On Android devices**, License Manager activities are captured in adb and RXLogger log files. 

**On Windows Mobile/CE devices**, License Manager activities are written to `LM_Log.txt` in the app's install directory. 

-----

## Notes
The following notes are derived from frequently asked questions about device licensing and apply to most licensing scenarios. 

* **Licenses erased by a [Factory Reset](/mx/powermgr/#enterprisereset) can be reissued <u>to the same device(s) using the same StageNow Profile</u>** and the same License Source (i.e. cloud-based or local server). 
* **When ordering additional unit entitlements for an existing site license, include the Activation ID** with the order to ensure that the same EMM policy can be used for the additional devices.
* **The fastest way to deploy a trial license on a device** is by using the License Manager app and the [manual license assignment](#iiimanuallyassignlicense) procedures above.
* **Device licenses can be activated using**: 
 * StageNow and the [License Mgr CSP](/stagenow/latest/csp/license)
 * OEMConfig tool, part of Zebra's EMM Toolkit (available to authorized partners only)

Q3: Where can I find more information about the LicenseMgr CSP that works with StageNow or my EMM ? 
A3 : You can find more info about the various parameters on Techdocs here.

Q5: I don't want to use StageNow but my preferred EMM of choice. What options do I have?

A5: The LicenseMgr CSP is published via the EMMToolkit as well as Zebra's OEMConfig interface. Please use either to access the various license management configurations.


Q4: I only want to try out my trial EB 2.0 license and not mass deploy it. Do I still need to use StageNow or an EMM ?

A4: For a one-off activation or license management operations, there is a built-in LicenseManager application on an EMC Android device that can be used. You can use this application to key in the Activation Id and choose the default Cloud option for the quickest way to get up and running.

A detailed guide for this application can be found on on Zebra.com's Licensing Page.


Q2. How does the license portal react to new device license purchases? Currently I have a total QTY of say 20.  I need to purchase more licenses this week.  Would the total QTY just increase?  The reason I ask is I’ll be pushing the license using StageNow via MDM. The MDM lets me push the license to an entire group of devices so all of my devices will receive the same license.  Defining in the system that 19 devices get license A and the rest get license B would be extremely difficult/near impossible.
A2. When the order for additional licenses is being placed, please provide the AID from your initial order while placing the new one. That will ensure the additional PO qty is added to your initial entitlement and you can use the same MDM policy on the additional devices as well

<!-- 
## `TO BE MODIFIED`

If the user wants to enable an entitlement via a pre-activated license, this option should be chosen under Select

License Source drop-down list with the Production Cloud as the Preactivated Source.
The user cannot add any license source under this option.
This option also caters to an enterprise wide license that serves as a pre-activated license for a set of devices
offered to select software SKUs.

To activate a pre-activated license (offline activation) for any of the Zebra Software Products, follow the steps given below:

Start the License Manager application.
Click the floating action button on the Opening/Home screen. This will open the Activation screen as shown in Figure 5.
This page has the following input fields, where the information needs to be added for activating a license:
 

Note: Always choose the type of the license source under Select License Source option prior to inputting any data in the license field above. 

Select License Source: If the user wants to activate a license offline, then the Pre-activated option has to be chosen under Select License Source drop down list and a pre-activated source has to be chosen under Select "Pre-activated Source" dropdown list as shown in Figure 10.
Select pre-activated Source: The pre-activated source is either the Production Cloud or Tet Cloud which depends on whether the license binary file was downloaded from Production Cloud Portal or Test Cloud Portal.

FIGURES 10, 11



Select the License Binary File: The user can click on the (…) browse button denoted by three dots beside the license input field. On clicking the button for the first time on the device, the user will be prompted with a runtime permission dialog asking for Storage permission only on devices running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and higher only as shown in Figure 12. In order to select a license binary file from the device, the user has to grant the storage permission for the License Manager application. This permission dialog will not be shown on subsequent selections if the permission is granted. On granting the storage permissions, the user will be prompted with a file picker to select a valid license binary file as shown in Figure 13.  On selecting a valid license binary file, the path of the binary file will be shown in the Select the License Binary file input field as shown in Figure 14. Note that this field will be populated automatically based on the path of the license binary file chosen and the user cannot edit the value of this field.

<br>

After selecting a valid License Source, click on the Submit button.
On clicking the Submit button, a dialog box is shown to the user which informs about the impact of not setting the system time correctly. This dialog box is displayed both in online and pre-activated license activation scenarios. The user can tick the Don’t ask again checkbox to hide the dialog box on the future license activations.
The Application processes the license binary file and displays whether the license activation was successful or not.
If the license activation is successful, the activated license information is displayed in the form of a card in the Home screen as shown in Figure 9. Details about the license information in the Home Screen can be found here.
All the license rights displayed in the Home Screen are available for acquisition on the device.
License Source Selection:
To select an existing license source from Activation Page, follow the steps given below:

On clicking on the Select License Source input field on the Activation page, License Source Selection screen will be displayed.
This page has the following input fields, where the information regarding the license source needs to be selected/added for activating a license:
Select License Source: This field lists all the license sources available on the device. A valid license source has to be selected from this field. This field usually denotes the name of the server for any of the user-added license sources. There are three default license sources available as shown in Figure 15:
1)      Cloud

2)      Local Server

3)      Pre-activated

FIGURE 15

<br>

Cloud: Depending on the type of the Cloud server, the user can choose from one of the below options under Select Connectivity drop down list as shown in Figure 16:

Production Cloud Direct: For directly activating the licenses from the default Zebra Production Server. The user cannot add any license source under this option as shown in Figure 17.
Test Cloud Direct: For directly activating the licenses from the default Zebra Test Server. The user cannot add any license source under this option as shown in Figure 18.
Production Cloud Through Proxy: For activating the licenses from a proxy server to the Production Cloud Server. The user can enter the unique URL and the name of the proxy server and add it as a separate license source under this option as shown in Figure 19.
Test Cloud Through Proxy: For activating the licenses from a proxy server to the Test Cloud Server. The user can enter the unique URL and the name of the proxy server and add it as a separate license source under this option as shown in Figure 20.
Custom Cloud: For activating the licenses from a Custom/Relay server. The user can enter the unique URL and the name of the custom server and add it as a separate license source under this option as shown in Figure 21.

FIGURE 16

<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="16.png"/>
_Unlicensed version_
<br>

ii)                   Local Server: This license source option corresponds to the On-Premise Server setup locally. The user can select Local Server option under Select License Source drop down and then enter the details of the On-Premise Server setup such as the unique URL and the name used to identify the server as shown in Figure 22. This adds a new License Source and will be available for subsequent activations under the Select License Source drop down list.

 

iii)                 Pre-activated: If the user wants to activate a pre-activated license, this option has to be chosen under Select License Source drop down list and a valid pre-activated source has to be chosen under Select Pre-activated Source dropdown menu as shown in Figure 23. The pre-activated source is either the Production Cloud or Test Cloud which depends on whether the license binary file was downloaded from Production Cloud Portal or Test Cloud Portal. The user cannot add any license source under this option.

The user has the provision to add new license sources of the proxy servers (Production Cloud Through Proxy or Test Cloud Through Proxy), Custom Cloud server (Relay server) and Local (On-Premise Server) server based license sources using the steps mentioned here. Note that all the license sources added by the user are read only. The name of all the license sources added by the user will be displayed in this field below the above three options.

 Enter URL: This input field is displayed only when the user is given the provision to add a new license source. The user has to enter the URL of the license source in this field. This field will also be visible while viewing any user-added license source but will be read only.
Name: This input field is displayed only when the user is given the provision to add a new license source. The user has to enter a unique name of the license source in this field. This field will also be visible while viewing any user-added license source. The name added in this field will be added to the list of the license sources saved on the device.

## Adding a License Source

("license source addition")

The user has the provision to add a new Proxy Server (Production Proxy/Test Proxy), Custom Server or a Local Server based license source. New License Sources can be added from Activation Page or from Settings Page.

To add a new license source from Activation Page, follow the steps given below:

1)      If the user wants to add a license source which is Proxy to the Production Server, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Cloud and Select Connectivity field should be set to Production Cloud Through Proxy as shown in Fig 24.

2)      If the user wants to add a license source which is a Proxy to the Test Server, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Cloud and Select Connectivity field should be set to Test Cloud Through Proxy as shown in Fig 26.

3)      If the user wants to add a license source for a Custom Cloud (Relay) Server, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Cloud and Select Connectivity field should be set to Custom Cloud as shown in Fig 28.

4)      If the user wants to add a Local license source, then the Select License Source field has to be set to Local Server as shown in Figure 30.

5)      In all the above cases, the user will be prompted to enter a valid server URL and a unique name to identify the license source.

6)      Once valid data is entered in the URL and Name input fields, the license source can be saved by clicking on the Submit button and license source added toast message is displayed to the user on successfully saving the license source.

7)      All the valid license sources added by the user will be displayed in the Select License Source drop down list once they are saved on the device as shown in Figure 32.

8)      Note that all the license sources (Proxy/Custom/Local) added by the user are read only and a maximum of ten license sources can be saved on the device at a time (which includes only the Custom Server and Local Server based license sources) including the default Production Cloud Direct and Test Cloud Direct license sources. Hence the user can add a maximum of eight license sources (can be either Custom license sources only or Local license sources only or combination of both). There is no limit for the Proxy server based license sources.

9)      All the license sources are also displayed in License Sources screen in Settings as shown in Figure 33. New license sources can also be added through License sources screen in Settings as explained here.

## Display Active Licenses

Active Licenses Display
All the licenses currently active on the device are displayed in the form of cards in the Home Screen as shown in Figures 34 and 35. Each card in this screen corresponds to an active license.

Each license (card) displayed in the Home screen has the following information:

The first row in the card has the name of the organization who purchased the license along with the last four digits of the activation (rights) id used for activating the license.
The second row in the card corresponds to the License Type. Valid license types include Perpetual, Permanent, Trial License, Test, etc.
The third row in the card corresponds to the expiry date of the license in the format MM/DD/YYYY. If the license is going to expire within 30 days from the current date, the expiry date is shown in red color as shown in the second license card in Figure 35. Else the expiry date is shown in black color.
The expiry date will be displayed as mentioned above if the license type is Perpetual and the license has a valid expiry date as shown in Figure 34. In case the license type is Perpetual but with no fixed expiry date (implying a permanent license), the expiry date field is shown as Perpetual License.
