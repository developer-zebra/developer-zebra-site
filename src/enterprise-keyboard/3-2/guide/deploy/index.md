## Overview

Enterprise Keyboard (EKB) versions available as an `.apk` file can be downloaded and deployed to compatible and configured on those devices using Zebra [StageNow](../../../../stagenow) and the [UI Manager](/mx/uimgr/) service or through a company's own enterprise mobility management (EMM) system (if supported by that system). 

This guide covers the basic procedures for mass-deployment of Enterprise Keyboard and layouts made with [Enterprise Keyboard Designer](/ekd) (EKB Designer or EKD), Zebra's Windows-based tool for creating custom key layouts for EKB. 

> **Zebra strongly recommends testing all apps and configuration files on a working device before general deployment**.

### Requirements
* EKB installation package (`.apk`)
* StageNow or a compatible EMM system
* **Optional**: EKD layout definition file (i.e. `LayoutProjectName.encrypted`)

### About EKD Files 
Data for custom key layout(s) is stored in the custom key-layout definition file, an encrypted file generated by Enterprise Keyboard Designer that contains information about key locations, key-value assignments, etc. for each key layout created. This single file can contain as many as 20 layout groups, each of which defines one layout. 

`IMPORTANT NOTES:`

* **Enterprise Keyboard 3.2 (or higher) must be installed and set as the default input method on the device** to display layouts made with EKD. 
* **Apps on the device can access <u>only a single EKD project file</u>**; all layouts required for a device MUST be stored in that single file.  
* **<u>Only one keyboard or custom key layout can be displayed on the device screen at a time</u>**. When a custom key layout is displayed, all other keyboards are hidden, including the standard Enterprise Keyboard alpha-numeric layout. 
* **To display an EKD layout, it must be called by an app using intents** (see [EKB APIs section](../apis)).
* EKD project files **can be decrypted on the device only by Enterprise Keyboard and [Enterprise Browser](/enterprise-browser)**. 
* The layout definition file must be stored in the `/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config/` folder on the device. 


1. **Locate the key layout definition file** (i.e. `LayoutProjectName.encrypted`) on the development host computer. <br>
 By default, the files are saved in the download directory of the current user: <br>
 `c:\Users\userName\Downloads\LayoutProjectName.encrypted`<br>
 **NOTE**: When clicking EKD's "Save Project" button, the default save-to folder is shown as in the image below: 
 <img alt="" style="height:250px" src="ekd_project_saved.png"/>
 _Click image to enlarge, ESC to exit_.
 <br>
2. In the "Language and input" Settings panel on the device, **set Enterprise Keyboard as a default keyboard**.
3. **Push definition file to the device** folder:<br>
 `/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config/`

**Custom key layouts are available on the device immediately upon file deployment**.
