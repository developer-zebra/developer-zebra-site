## Overview

The data for custom key layout(s) is stored in the custom key-layout definition file, an encrypted file generated by the [Enterprise Keyboard Designer](/ekd) (EKB Designer or EKD). This file contains information about key locations, key-value assignments, etc. for each key layout created. This single file can contain as many as 20 layout groups, each of which defines a layout. **NOTE: An app can access only a single layout file on the device; all layouts required for a device MUST be stored in that single file**. 

The layout definition file must be stored in the `/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config/` folder on the device. 


#### To deploy a key layout definition file:

1. **Locate the key layout definition file** (i.e. `LayoutProjectName.encrypted`) on the development host computer. <br>
 By default, the files are saved in the download directory of the current user: <br>
 `c:\Users\userName\Downloads\LayoutProjectName.encrypted`<br>
 **NOTE**: When clicking EKD's "Save Project" button, the default save-to folder is shown as in the image below: 
 <img alt="" style="height:250px" src="ekd_project_saved.png"/>
 _Click image to enlarge, ESC to exit_.
 <br>
2. In the "Language and input" Settings panel on the device, **set Enterprise Keyboard as a default keyboard**.
3. **Push definition file to the device** folder:<br>
 `/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config/`

**Custom key layouts are available on the device immediately upon file deployment**.
