## Overview
The setup process for Enterprise Keyboard (EKB) varies by device, and activation is sometimes necessary to make it available to users. Zebra's keyboard also can be set as the default input method, if desired. This section of the guide covers installation (for EKB 3.2 and higher), manual activation and the steps required for setting it as the default input device. 

For advanced settings, such as language selection and scan-tab configuration, please see the [Customize section](../settings) of this guide. 

Enterprise Keyboard 1.1 (and higher) can be installed, activated and configured: 

* Manually at the device
* Remotely:
    * Zebra's StageNow device configuration tool and the [UI Manager](/stagenow/latest/csp/ui/) and [Enterprise Keyboard Manager](/stagenow/latest/csp/enterprisekeyboard) services (requires MX 6.3 or higher on the device) 
    * Through a company's own enterprise mobility management (EMM) system (if supported by that system)

[Visit the Support Portal](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/productivity-apps/enterprise-keyboard.html) for specific EKB device and OS support information. Installation and upgrade instructions are below. 

> **Before beginning any installation...**
> 1. **Go to the [EKB download page](../../download) and follow instructions** to get the correct file(s) for the target device(s). <br>

## Automated Activation
Enterprise Keyboard 1.1 (and higher) can be configured remotely on multiple managed devices using Zebra's [StageNow](../../../../) tools and the [UI Manager](/mx/uimgr/) service or an organization's own MDM system.  

Actions to be executed on the Android Settings panel:
1. <b>Open Language and input</b> 
2. Add a check for <b>"Enterprise Keyboard"</b> to enable it on the device
3. <b>Select Enterprise Keyboard</b> as the default input device
4. <b>Select a language</b> (if other than the system default)

### Set as Default Input Device
Whether using the UI Manager service through Zebra's StageNow or EMDK tools, or if deploying Enterprise Keyboard from a company's own MDM, it is necessary to specify Enterprise Keyboard's package and class names to select it as the default keyboard on the device. 

The required package and class names are shown as the values below, wrapped by the coding necessary for using one of Zebra's tools: 

		:::xml  
		<parm name="InputMethodPackageName" value="com.symbol.mxmf.csp.enterprisekeyboard"/>
		<parm name="InputMethodClassName" value="com.android.inputmethod.latin.LatinIME"/>

For additional information about usage and syntax, please refer to respective documentation.

## Manual Deactivation

Enterprise Keyboard cannot be removed if it was included with the device operating system. However, it can be deactivated by reversing the activation process described in the Activation section. The steps below describe how to deactivate Enterprise Keyboard using the Android Settings panel. 

<b>Warning: This action renders Enterprise Keyboard inaccessible, including its scanning and other capabilities</b>. 

**Deactivate Enterprise Keyboard on a device**: 

&#49;. <b>Open the Settings panel</b> on the device:
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="home_screen.png"/>
<br>

&#50;. Scroll to and <b>tap the "Language and input" control</b>:
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="input_in_settings.png"/>
<br>

&#51;. <b>Remove the check next to "Enterprise Keyboard"</b> to disable it on the device. If the Android keyboard is the only other input device, it automatically becomes the default input device and cannot be disabled. 
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="panel_default.png"/>
<br> 

Manual deactivation of Enterprise Keyboard is complete.

## Automated Deactivation
Enterprise Keyboard 1.1 (and higher) can be deactivated on multiple managed devices using an organization's own MDM server in the same way as other Android apps. Alternatively, remote uninstallation can be accomplished through Zebra's [EMDK](/../../../../) or [StageNow](../../../../) tools using the [App Manager](/mx/appmgr) service.
