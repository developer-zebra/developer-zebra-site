## Overview
Enterprise Keyboard (EKB) setup varies by device but activation is always necessary to make it available to users. EKB also can be set as the default input method, if desired. 

EKB can be activated and configured: 

* Manually at the device (covered here)
* Remotely (covered elsewhere):
    * Zebra's StageNow device configuration tool and the [UI Manager](http://techdocs.zebra.com/stagenow/latest/csp/ui/) and [Enterprise Keyboard Manager](http://techdocs.zebra.com/stagenow/latest/csp/enterprisekeyboard) services (requires MX 6.3 or higher on the device) 
    * Through a company's own enterprise mobility management (EMM) system (if compatible; see that system's info) 

#### This guide covers: 

* [Installation](#installupgradeekb) of user-app versions of EKB
* [Manual activation](#manualactivation) and setting EKB as the default input source 

**For advanced settings**, such as language selection and scan-tab configuration: 

* See the [Customize section](../settings) of this guide.

## Install/Upgrade EKB 
<!-- removed per eng. (idea was that these are the only downloadable versions) 
_Applies only to user-app (`.apk`) versions of Enterprise Keyboard (incl. 1.4&ndash;1.6 and 3.2)_. 
 -->
Some versions of EKB can be downloaded from the [Zebra Support Portal](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/productivity-apps/enterprise-keyboard.html) and installed as a user app. **Devices running Android 7.x Nougat (or higher) with older versions of EKB can be upgraded to the latest EKB version using the latest** `.apk` **file**. [Visit the Support Portal](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/productivity-apps/enterprise-keyboard.html) for specific EKB device and OS support information. Installation and upgrade instructions are below. 

> **Before beginning any installation...**
> 1. **See [EKB download instructions](../../download) and get the correct file(s)** for the target device(s). <br>
> 2. **Ensure that target device(s) are able to connect** via USB to the host computer. [Get USB drivers](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/drivers/android-usb-driver.html)<br>
> 3. Note that **Enterprise Keyboard requires [activation](#manualactivation)** following installation. 

### Upgrade/install using USB

1. Connect the device via USB to the host computer that contains the downloaded `Enterprisekeyboard.apk` file.  
2. **Copy the** `Enterprisekeyboard.apk` **file to the root directory** of the device.
3. **Navigate to the file** using a file manager app on the device. 
4. **Tap the file to install it**. 
5. **See [Verify Installation](#verifyinstallation)** section below. 

> **NOTE**: After installation, Enterprise Keyboard requires [activation](#manualactivation). 

-----

### Upgrade/install using adb

1. **Connect the device via USB to the host computer** that contains the downloaded `Enterprisekeyboard.x.x.x.x.apk` file (where "x.x.x.x" = EKB version number).
2. **For devices with an older EKB already installed**, run the following command:

		:::terminal
		adb install â€“r EnterpriseKeyboard_file_name.apk
_The "-r" option **reinstalls** an existing app and retains any existing user data_.

2. **For devices with no prior version of EKB installed**, run the following command:<br>

		:::terminal
		adb install EnterpriseKeyboard_file_name.apk
4. **See [Verify Installation](#verifyinstallation)** section below. 

> **NOTE**: After installation, **Enterprise Keyboard requires [activation](#manualactivation)**.

## Uninstalling/Downgrading EKB

####Notes:
* **If EKB was installed as a user app on a device with no prior version**, removal is the same as for any standard Android app. 
* **If EKB was installed as an upgrade on a device with EKB preinstalled**, removal reverts to the preinstalled version. 

### Uninstall using adb

1. **Connect the host computer to the device** that contains the Enterprise Keyboard to be uninstalled.   
2. **From a terminal window**, run the following command: 

		:::terminal
		adb uninstall com.symbol.mxmf.csp.enterprisekeyboard

3. To verify uninstallation, use the [Verify Installation](#verifyinstallation) instructions below to confirm that EKB was removed or downgraded to the preinstalled version.  

### Uninstall using the Settings panel

1. **On the device that contains the Enterprise Keyboard to be uninstalled**:<br>
 Go to **Settings -> Apps & Notification -> Enterprise Keyboard** 
2. **Tap "Disable" then "Disable App" then "OK"** to confirm the downgrade.<br> 
 When uninstallation completes, the older EKB version number is displayed.
3. **Tap the "Enable" button to use the older EKB version**.
4. To use a different keyboard see the [Manual Activation](#manualactivation) section.

#### If removing EKB installed as a user app:

1. **On the device that contains the Enterprise Keyboard to be uninstalled**:<br>

## Automated Activation
Enterprise Keyboard 1.1 (and higher) can be configured remotely on multiple managed devices using Zebra's [StageNow](/stagenow) tools and the [UI Manager](http://techdocs.zebra.com/stagenow/latest/csp/ui) service or an organization's own MDM system.  

Actions to be executed on the Android Settings panel:
1. <b>Open Language and input</b> 
2. Add a check for <b>"Enterprise Keyboard"</b> to enable it on the device
3. <b>Select Enterprise Keyboard</b> as the default input device
4. <b>Select a language</b> (if other than the system default)

### Set as Default Input Device
Whether using the UI Manager service through Zebra's StageNow or EMDK tools, or if deploying Enterprise Keyboard from a company's own MDM, it is necessary to specify Enterprise Keyboard's package and class names to select it as the default keyboard on the device. 

The required package and class names are shown as the values below, wrapped by the coding necessary for using one of Zebra's tools: 

		:::xml  
		<parm name="InputMethodPackageName" value="com.symbol.mxmf.csp.enterprisekeyboard"/>
		<parm name="InputMethodClassName" value="com.android.inputmethod.latin.LatinIME"/>

For additional information about usage and syntax, please refer to respective documentation.

## Manual Deactivation

Enterprise Keyboard cannot be removed if it was included with the device operating system. However, it can be deactivated by reversing the activation process described in the Activation section. The steps below describe how to deactivate Enterprise Keyboard using the Android Settings panel. 

<b>Warning: This action renders Enterprise Keyboard inaccessible, including its scanning and other capabilities</b>. 

**Deactivate Enterprise Keyboard on a device**: 

&#49;. <b>Open the Settings panel</b> on the device:
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="home_screen.png"/>
<br>

&#50;. Scroll to and <b>tap the "Language and input" control</b>:
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="input_in_settings.png"/>
<br>

> **`NOTE:` To deactivate EKB on the EC30 and certain other devices**:<br>
> Go to **Settings -> System -> Languages & input -> Virtual Keyboard -> Enterprise Keyboard**

&#51;. <b>Remove the check next to "Enterprise Keyboard"</b> to disable it on the device. If the Android keyboard is the only other input device, it automatically becomes the default input device and cannot be disabled. 
<img alt="" style="height:350px" src="panel_default.png"/>
<br> 

##### Manual deactivation of Enterprise Keyboard is complete. 

-----

## Automated Deactivation
Enterprise Keyboard 1.1 (and higher) can be deactivated on multiple managed devices using an organization's own MDM server in the same way as other Android apps.
