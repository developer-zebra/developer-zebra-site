### Remote Management
Enterprise Keyboard can be installed and activated remotely using Zebra's StageNow device configuration tool and the [UI Manager](/stagenow/latest/csp/ui/) and [Enterprise Keyboard Manager](/stagenow/latest/csp/enterprisekeyboard) services (requires MX 6.3 or higher on the device). Alternatively, a company's own enterprise mobility management (EMM) system can be used for remote administration if supported by that system.
