## Overview

Enterprise Keyboard (EKB) versions available as an `.apk` file can be downloaded and deployed to compatible devices and configured on those devices using Zebra [StageNow](../../../../stagenow) and the [UI Manager](http://techdocs.zebra.com/stagenow/latest/csp/ui) service or through a company's own enterprise mobility management (EMM) system (if supported by that system). **This guide covers the basic procedures for mass-deployment of the Enterprise Keyboard `apk` file and layouts made with [Enterprise Keyboard Designer](/ekd) (EKB Designer or EKD), Zebra's Windows-based tool for creating custom key layouts for EKB**. 

> **Zebra strongly recommends testing apps, configuration files and deployment settings on a working device before general deployment**.

### Requirements
* **EKB installation package** (`.apk`)
* **StageNow** or a compatible EMM system
* **EKD layout definition file** (optional)

#### About EKD Files 
Data for custom key layout(s) is stored in the custom key-layout definition file, an encrypted file generated by Enterprise Keyboard Designer that contains information about key locations, key-value assignments, etc. for each key layout created. This single file can contain as many as 20 layout groups, each of which defines one layout. 

#### `IMPORTANT EKD NOTES:`

* **Enterprise Keyboard 3.2 (or higher) must be installed and set as the default input method on the device** to display layouts made with EKD. 
* **Apps on the device can access <u>only a single EKD project file</u>**; all layouts required for a device MUST be stored in that single file.  
* **<u>Only one keyboard or custom key layout can be displayed on the device screen at a time</u>**. When a custom key layout is displayed, all other keyboards are hidden, including the standard Enterprise Keyboard alpha-numeric layout. 
* **To display an EKD layout, it must be called by an app using intents** (see [EKB APIs section](../apis)).
* EKD project files **can be decrypted on the device only by Enterprise Keyboard and [Enterprise Browser](/enterprise-browser)**. 
* The layout definition file must be stored in the `/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config/` folder on the device. 
* **Do NOT deploy empty key layout files**; they can cause Enterprise Keyboard to behave unpredictably.
* **The "Switch-Scan" Press Action sometimes displays a layout *other* than the expected EKB "scan" layout**. 
* **When using DataWedge to switch layouts**, the EKB fixed layout is sometimes shown briefly or until the focus changes again. 
* **When custom layouts are displayed, <u>all EKB settings, preferences and functions are suspended</u>**.

### Mass-deploy EKB/EKD files

1. In StageNow or compatible EMM, **create an installation package containing EKB `.apk` and/or EKD layout definition file(s)**. <br>
 By default, EKD layout definition files are saved in the `\Downloads` directory of the host-computer user on the system on which they were created. For example: <br>
 `c:\Users\userName\Downloads\[LayoutProjectName.encrypted]`<br>
2. **Deploy EKB to the the root directory** of the target device(s). 
3. If included, **deploy layout definition file to**: <br>
 `/enterprise/device/settings/ekb/config/`
4. **After all device downloads complete, launch EKB**.
5. **Configure EKB as the default input source**.  
6. **Restart the device**. 

#### Upon restart, EKB is the default keyboard and custom key layouts are available for use.

#### See the [EKB API Guide](../apis) for layout usage info.
