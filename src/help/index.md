## Overview

Zebra Technologies provides devices for the enterprise to acquire, process and consume data from barcodes, magnetic stripe cards, RFID tags, smart cards, images, text and other technologies. To enable Zebra partners and customers of varying skills and requirements to make use of its devices, Zebra offers a broad array of tools designed to suit the requirements and capabilities of most any organization.

## Scanning
Zebra mobile and touch computers are equipped with a variety of scanning devices, each of which can be accessed through software included with the device or with apps developed by a partner or customer. Zebra's solutions are described below in order from easiest (and with the least coding required) to the most powerful and complex.  

### DataWedge
##### PROS: Free; Easy to set up; Built into all Zebra devices; Controlled with UI or intents
##### CONS: Fixed feature set; Programmatic access requires coding

###### Zebra recommends considering DataWedge before other Zebra solutions. 

[DataWedge](../datawedge) provides barcode scanning and processing services for devices running Android, and is the fastest and easiest way to perform scanning out of the box or add it to an existing app. Included with every Zebra device, DataWedge enables any app on the device to acquire scanned data without the need to access the scanner APIs directly. DataWedge can be configured in minutes to automatically activate the desired scanner or reader whenever a particular app is launched, and can modify and pass acquired data to an app according to simple or complex rules.

##### Need help deciding between DataWedge vs EMDK? See [DataWedge vs EMDK Comparison](#datawedgevsemdkcomparison)

-----

### SimulScan
##### PROS: Easy to set up; Built into many devices; No coding required; Controlled with APIs 
##### CONS: Limited device support; Setup can be complex; Some features require licensing

[SimulScan](../simulscan) can optimize workflow by acquiring multiple points of data in a single step. It's included with [supported devices](../simulscan/1-1/guide/about/#supporteddevices) and is free for many scanning scenarios. SimulScan is well suited to organizations in which scanning is frequent and scanned forms have either one or more barcodes or contain multiple data types to acquire (such as barcodes, text and images). Optionally, SimulScan can integrate with an organization's native Android app and parse captured data directly into the app. **A per-device licensing requirement applies to some scenarios**. 

##### Go to [SimulScan docs](../simulscan)

-----

### Enterprise Browser
##### PROS: Build cross-platform apps with HTML5 that access device APIs; Broad device support
##### CONS: Requires some JavaScript coding; Longer setup times; Licensing required 

[Enterprise Browser](../enterprise-browser) is a small-footprint web browser platform that uses industry-standard HTML5 for building cross-platform scanning apps with minimal coding. Runtime settings are stored in a single config file that's simple to understand, easy to modify and suitable for mass-deployment. Tools included with the platform simplify initial on-ramping and device configuration and debugging. 

##### Go to [Enterprise Browser docs](../enterprise-browser)

-----

### EMDK
##### PROS: Most customizable solution; Complete control over all source code 
##### CONS: Requires Java or C# coding; Potentially long setup and testing times

Organizations with access to Java and/or C# developers can use [EMDK for Android](../emdk-for-android) and/or [EMDK for Xamarin](../emdk-for-xamarin) SDKs to build or modify Java or C# apps that acquire data on Android devices. Both SDKs offer simplified access to device APIs through Profile Manager, which automatically generates the XML to drive Zebra's device management layer.

### DataWedge vs EMDK Comparison

It is common for developers to be faced with the decision to choose between DataWedge or EMDK to integrate barcode scanning within their app. This comparison chart describes the differences and similarities between both, with DataWedge being the simpler route:

## Security

### Application Security
Zebra security ranges from simple, feature-based solutions to whole-device lock-down with or without encryption. 

**[Enterprise Home Screen](../ehs)** is a simple way to control user access to apps, settings and files on Zebra devices running Android without the need for custom code.  

**[Enterprise Browser security options](../enterprise-browser/1-7/guide/security)** protect devices and data with a variety of solutions including basic authentication, client-server certificates, encryption, kiosk mode, and settings lock-out.  

**[Zebra StageNow manages security](../stagenow/2-7/Profiles/managesecurity/)** with Zebra Mobility DNA, which can lock down peripherals, keys and ports, implement application whitelists and blacklists and set up services to monitor threats and send alerts in real time. Learn more about Zebra Mobility DNA features, which can:  
* **[Verify the signature of an app before launching](../mx/accessmgr)**
* **[Set up encryption on a device](../mx/encryptmgr/)**
* **[Control device persistence settings](../mx/persistmgr/)**
* **[Lock down one or more device cameras](../mx/cameramgr/)**
* **[Prevent use of the device Clipboard, Notification panel and other potential leaks](../mx/uimgr)**

### Whole-device Security

#### Create a Single-Use Device (Kiosk)
When a device will be dedicated to a single task&mdash;an information kiosk, patient check-in system or price scanner, for example&mdash;Zebra's Enterprise Home Screen might be a good choice. Kiosk Mode opens one app in full-screen mode and prevents exiting when BACK and HOME keys are pressed.

Learn more about [EHS Kiosk Mode](../ehs/2-6/guide/features/#kioskmode)

## App Migration
When there's a need to move an existing app from one device platform to another&mdash;such as from Windows CE to Android&mdash;Zebra offers multiple solutions to help ease the transition. Migration tools can put a new face on older apps or help move apps from older platforms to new ones.

### Enterprise Browser

[Migrate from Pocket Browser](../enterprise-browser/1-6/guide/pb2/)

[Migrate from Rho Elements](../enterprise-browser/1-6/guide/elements/)

[Migrate from Rho Mobile](../enterprise-browser/1-6/guide/rhomobile/)

### EMDK for Xamarin
