## Overview

**[Zebra Mobility DNA](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/software/mobile-computers/mobility-dna.html)** is a set of tools and features for enhancing productivity, performance and security of Zebra devices running Android. 

**With its two-tiered system, Zebra gives partners the flexibility** of selecting full-featured Enterprise devices out of the gate, or reducing initial costs with the Professional series and upgrading as their organization grows.

* **Zebra Professional-series devices provide the core elements of MDNA**, equipping devices such as the TC21 and TC26 with the most critical tools for app development and device management for enterprise mobility deployments of all sizes. 
* **Zebra Enterprise-series devices include the full MDNA suite** of enhancements for increased levels of productivity, performance and security.  

> **`IMPORTANT:`<br>When Multi-user Android is enabled on a device**, MX and Mobility DNA features work only with Primary users.
