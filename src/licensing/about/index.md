## Overview

**Zebra Professional-series devices provide the core elements** of Zebra's [Mobility DNA](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/software/mobile-computers/mobility-dna.html) software of development and management tools for enterprise mobility deployments of all sizes. 

**Zebra Enterprise-series devices include the full suite** of the MDNA catalog of connectivity enhancements and tools for increased levels of productivity, performance and security. Zebra allows partners the flexibility of selecting Enterprise-series devices out of the gate, or upgrading from the Professional series as their organization grows.

## Software Components

### DataWedge
DataWedge provides the capability for any application on the device to acquire data from various input sources (such as barcode scanner, MSR, RFID, voice, and serial port) and manipulate the data as needed based on simple options or complex rules. Available out-of-the-box with every Zebra Android device, DataWedge can easily be configured to automatically provide data capture services within any particular app; to use a particular scanner, reader or other peripheral device; and to properly format and transmit data to the right app. [Learn more](/datawedge).

#### Multi-barcode scanning
**Multi-barcode options** currently available for licensing include [Number of barcodes per scan](https://techdocs.zebra.com//datawedge/latest/guide/input/barcode#basicmultibarcodeparams) which allows setting a fixed quantity of barcodes to scan; [Instant Reporting](https://techdocs.zebra.com//datawedge/latest/guide/input/barcode#basicmultibarcodeparams), which instantaneously reports unique barcodes within a scanning session; and [Report decoded barcodes](http://techdocs.zebra.com/datawedge/latest/guide/input/barcode#basicmultibarcodeparams) for reporting decoded barcodes in a single scan session. Multi-barcode features are enabled through the **Scanning Modes** option in [NextGen SimulScan configuration](http://techdocs.zebra.com/datawedge/latest/guide/input/barcode#scanningmodes).

### Device Diagnostics
Device Diagnostic Tool instantly tests and diagnoses the hardware operability on Zebra mobile devices to determine system health and functionality. Where appropriate, Zebra Help Desk uses this tool for troubleshooting device issues, relying on the results to provide optimum steps to reach a resolution. It is useful for quickly troubleshooting device issues, resulting to increased worker productivity, limited device downtime, and unnecessary returns to the Zebra Repair Center. [Learn more](/ddt).

### EMDK-A
**EMDK for Android extends Android Studio for Mac OS and Windows** with tools for easily creating powerful line-of-business applications for Zebra Android devices. EMDK for Android includes class libraries, sample apps and source code, enabling developers to easily build apps that take full advantage of the power of Zebra devices. **Also included is Profile Manager**, a GUI-based tool for generating all the code required to access and configure Zebra device features and settings. This enables developers to target Zebra devices with fewer lines of code, fewer errors and reduced overall development time. [Learn more](/emdk-for-android).

### EMDK-X
**EMDK for Xamarin is an IDE extension** that provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools to easily create powerful line-of-business applications for Zebra Android devices using C# skills and tools. EMDK for Xamarin includes class libraries, sample applications and source code, and all associated documentation for building applications that take full advantage of the power of Zebra devices. **Also included is Profile Manager**, a GUI-based tool for generating all the code required to access and configure Zebra device features and settings. This enables developers to target Zebra devices with fewer lines of code, fewer errors and reduced overall development time. [Learn more](/emdk-for-xamarin). 

### Enterprise Home Screen
**Enterprise Home Screen is a free replacement launcher for Zebra devices running Android** that provides a simple way for administrators to control access to apps and settings on a Zebra device without the need to write custom code. Using a simple touch interface, EHS easily limits usage to one or more specified applications, prevents changes to device settings and locks down the file system. It can be configured in seconds, and settings can be deployed using an EMM. EHS settings are stored in a simple XML file that's easy to read and edit by hand, if desired. [Learn more](/ehs).

### StageNow
**StageNow is Zebra's device-staging utility for configuring Zebra devices**. This free tool provides a point-and-click environment that allows administrators and staging operators to quickly set up and deploy devices by scanning, tapping an NFC tag or reading settings from in a file. StageNow integrates seamlessly with most Enterprise Mobility Management systems for easy mass deployment across an enterprise. [Learn more](/stagenow).  

### Device Central
**Device Central provides a centralized method for an organization to connect and monitor supported Bluetooth peripherals**. Using a simple user interface, Device Central easily pairs and unpairs Bluetooth peripherals, monitors connection status, and provides details on supported peripherals. If supported by the peripheral, additional capabilities can include paging peripherals and updating firmware. Device Central is preinstalled on all supported Zebra devices. [Learn more](/devicecentral).

### Device Tracker
**Device Tracker is a centralized solution for tracking and locating misplaced devices within a facility** to help improve worker productivity and prevent device inventory shrinkage. As part of [Zebra DNA Visibility Console](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/software/mobile-computers/mobility-dna.html), Device Tracker leverages a company's existing Wi-Fi network infrastructure, adding Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signaling and audio alerts to aid in device location. [Learn more](/devicetracker).

### Enterprise Keyboard
**Enterprise Keyboard (EKB) is a soft input device that's designed to provide the most productive means possible of inputting data into Zebra devices**. Building on the stock Android keyboard, Enterprise Keyboard provides programmable keys, can switch quickly between languages and key layouts, and has the ability to scan barcode data directly into an application using any of the device's scanners. [Learn more](enterprise-keyboard).

### Over-the-air LifeGuard updates 
#### `DESCRIPTION and WEB LINK NEEDED`

### Power Precision Console
**PowerPrecision Console (PPC) is a battery management solution** that provides organizations using Zebra mobile computing devices with a centralized view of the health, state-of-charge and performance data of device batteries within an organization. Using data gathered and stored in Zebra's PowerPrecision batteries, PPC provides administrators with insight that can help them determine when battery health could affect productivity and when a device battery should be removed from service. The PPC centralized management system continuously monitors battery health data analyzed in real time, and can trigger customized notifications to alert device users of actions needed for battery swapping or decommissioning, helping to ensure optimized deployment of healthy batteries at all times. [Learn more](/ppc).

### Wi-Fi Locationing
#### `DESCRIPTION and WEB LINK NEEDED`

### WorryFree Wi-Fi Analyzer
WorryFree Wi-Fi Analyzer is a real-time Wi-Fi analysis and troubleshooting tool designed to example and help resolve Wi-Fi issues from a mobile device. It packages multiple troubleshooting capabilities:

RF network scanning
Device WiFi coverage monitor
End-to-end WiFi connectivity analysis
Roaming analysis
Voice analysis and data log, including packet captures
It allows analysis of issues in real-time background mode while the device is used for regular productivity purposes.
