## Overview

**[Zebra Mobility DNA](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/software/mobile-computers/mobility-dna.html)** is a set of productivity, performance and security tools and features that enhance Zebra devices running Android. 

**With its two-tiered system, Zebra gives partners the flexibility** of selecting full-featured Enterprise devices out of the gate, or reducing initial costs with the Professional series and upgrading as their organization grows.

**Zebra Professional-series devices provide the core elements of MDNA**, equipping devices with the most critical tools for app development and device management for enterprise mobility deployments of all sizes. 

**Zebra Enterprise-series devices include the full MDNA suite** of enhancements for increased levels of productivity, performance and security.  

> `IMPORTANT:` When Multi-user Android is employed, **Mobile DNA features work only with Primary users**. 

-----

## MDNA Components and Features  
Here's what comes with Zebra Professional and Enterprise devices and the actions required to enhance a Pro device. 

**NOTE: Each <u>MDNA license covers all MDNA features</u> for one device**.
