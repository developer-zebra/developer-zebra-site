## Software Components

### DataWedge
DataWedge provides the capability for any application on the device to acquire data from various input sources (such as barcode scanner, MSR, RFID, voice, and serial port) ***without coding***, and to manipulate the data as needed based on simple options or complex rules. Available out-of-the-box with every Zebra Android device, DataWedge can easily be configured to automatically provide data capture services within any particular app; to use a particular scanner, reader or other peripheral device; and to properly format and transmit data to the right app. [Learn more](/datawedge).

#### Multi-barcode scanning
**Multi-barcode options** currently available for licensing include [Number of barcodes per scan](https://techdocs.zebra.com//datawedge/latest/guide/input/barcode#basicmultibarcodeparams) which allows setting a fixed quantity of barcodes to scan; [Instant Reporting](https://techdocs.zebra.com//datawedge/latest/guide/input/barcode#basicmultibarcodeparams), which instantaneously reports unique barcodes within a scanning session; and [Report decoded barcodes](http://techdocs.zebra.com/datawedge/latest/guide/input/barcode#basicmultibarcodeparams) for reporting decoded barcodes in a single scan session. Multi-barcode features are enabled through the **Scanning Modes** option in [NextGen SimulScan configuration](http://techdocs.zebra.com/datawedge/latest/guide/input/barcode#scanningmodes).
