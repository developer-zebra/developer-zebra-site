###Q: Can licenses erased from a device be reused?

**A: Yes. Licenses erased by a [Factory Reset](/mx/powermgr/#enterprisereset) or other device service process can be reissued <u>to the same device(s) using the same StageNow Profile</u>** and the same License Source (i.e. cloud-based or local server). 

-----

###Q: I already have some licenses in my organization. What's the best way add more?  


**A: When ordering additional unit entitlements for an existing site license, include the Activation ID** with the order to ensure that the same EMM policy can be used for the additional devices.

-----

###Q: Does Zebra offer evaluation licenses? 

**A: Yes. [See the Process page](../process/#evaluationlicense)** to learn how.  

-----

###Q: Are evaluation licenses installed in the same way as regular commercial licenses? 

**A: Yes. The fastest way to deploy an evaluation license on a device is manually**, by using the License Manager app and the [manual license assignment](../process/#iiimanuallyassignlicense) procedures.

* **Device licenses can be activated using**: 
 * StageNow and the [License Mgr CSP](https://techdocs.zebra.com/stagenow/latest/csp/license)
 * OEMConfig tool, part of Zebra's EMM Toolkit (available to authorized partners only)

###Q: I'm having trouble viewing the MX Feature table on a mobile device. Can that be improved? 

**A: Yes. Try enabling the "Desktop site"** (or similar) option in the mobile browser. 

Here's how it looks in Chrome for Android:
