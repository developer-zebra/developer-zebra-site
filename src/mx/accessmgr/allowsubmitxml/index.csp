Select whether or not to allow the application to submit XML. This will allow or restrict applications from submitting changes to the MX Framework. 

>**Note:** This feature is supported on devices that are running KitKat versions of Android like the TC70 and will only be used when the Whitelist feature is enabled.

>**WARNING:** Be sure to always include the EMDK for Android service package name `com.symbol.emdkservice` when this feature is enabled. Otherwise Profile Features (excluding DataCapture) will not be able to be processed.
