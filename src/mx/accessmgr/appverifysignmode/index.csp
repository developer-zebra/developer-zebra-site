This parm allows you to control whether Whitelisting will verify the signatures of applications, and if so, which application signatures will be verified. Signature verification is turned off by default.

When Whitelisting is turned on but Signature verification is turned off, the determination of whether an application is on the "white" list is made solely by comparing the Android Package Name. This is insecure since it cannot prevent a potentially rogue application from setting it's Package Name to be one that is known to be on the "white" list, and hence circumvent Whitelisting by impersonating a trusted application.

To increase security, Signature verification can be turned on. When Signature verification is turned on, the determination of whether an application is on the "white" list will be based on both its Package Name and its Signature. For that to work, the Signature must be provided for every application that is added to the "white" list so it can be compared against the actual Signature of that application.

Signature verification is more secure since only a specific "authentic" version, as identified by its Signature, of a given application, whose Package Name is on the "white" list, will be allowed to be installed and launched.  Turning on Signature verification also complicates the process of deploying applications since a unique Signature will need to be configured for each application as part of adding that application to the "white" list.
