Select the desired Operation Mode which will turn Whitelisting on or off. Whitelisting is turned off by default, and hence no restrictions are imposed on which applications device users can install or which applications can be launched.

Turning on Whitelisting allows a device to be made more secure by preventing a device user from installing applications that are not on the "white" list and by preventing all launching of applications that are not on the "white" list. Turning on Whitelisting also complicates the process of deploying applications since applications that are deployed and installed will have to also be added to the "white" list before they can be launched.
