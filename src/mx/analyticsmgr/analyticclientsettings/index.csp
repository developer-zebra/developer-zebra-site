The on-off switch for Analytics Client Settings, which allow AnalyticsMgr to control the ability of client components (such as [Stats](../stats)) to submit data and events to AnalyticsMgr for processing and transport. By enabling this parm, administrators have the ability set limits on incoming data and events with the throttling parms (below), and can choose whether to allow the upload of those elements to the cloud. Analytics Client Settings can be used to prevent the Analytics Engine from being overwhelmed by client activities.
