Enabling the Analytics Engine also launches the Elemez B2M client, which provides cloud transportation services for data collected on the device (See Enable File/Events Upload and Transport Method). **Access to this parameter can be blocked with the Data Analytics Usage (EnableDAEToggle) parameter**.
