Sends pre-set or custom commands from a remote location to the Analytics Engine on a device with instructions to perform specific actions. The **EnableFileUpload parameter must be set to "2" (enabled)** to perform upload commands. Please refer to the "Enable File/Events Upload" parm for details. Cloud transport is provided on Zebra devices by the Elemez B2M client, which is switched on whenever the Analytics Engine is enabled.
