Controls the maximum amount of data (in MB) that the AnalyticsMgr on a device will accept from client components (such as [Stats](../stats)) for processing and transport in any 24-hour period before generating "threshold crossed" events. It's important to note that throttling does not govern data collection itself, but only the **transfer** of data from client components to the AnalyticsMgr. When selecting a Custom value, use an integer from 1-9999.
