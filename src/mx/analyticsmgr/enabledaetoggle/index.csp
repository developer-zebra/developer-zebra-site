Controls access to the Data Analytics State (AnalyticsAction) parameter, which is the On/Off switch for the Data Analytics Engine (DAE) and data collection on the device. When the DAE Toggle is disabled (option 2), the data collection On/Off setting cannot be changed by the device user by or an app running on the device. **This parameter can act as a safeguard against undesired changes to data collection activities on the device**.
