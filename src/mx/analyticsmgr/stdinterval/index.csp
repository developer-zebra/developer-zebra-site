Allows the data collection interval to be set. Data will be collected by the Analytics Engine on the device at the given interval for a parameter that has met its threshold or has no condition assigned. This setting will apply to all metrics under a given Group Name when detailed metrics are configured for a single group. Otherwise, the collection interval will default to Low (every 60 minutes), Medium (every 30 minutes) and High (every 10 minutes).
