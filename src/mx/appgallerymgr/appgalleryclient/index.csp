This is the on/off switch for the AppGallery client app on the device. Disabling AppGallery removes its icon from the Android Launcher but does not remove the app itself; it can be switched on and off as desired and will retain all prior settings, including user credentials. **Note: Client settings persist following an enterprise reset**.
