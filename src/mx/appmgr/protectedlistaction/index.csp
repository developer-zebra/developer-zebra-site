The Protected List allows specified applications to be exempted from certain constraints imposed on applications when Multi-User Mode is enabled. Applications with Package Names on the Protected List will:

* Be allowed to launch when no device user is logged in
* Not be terminated when a device user logs out
* Maintain a single copy of data for use by all users, even if Multi-User Data Separation is enabled

>**Note:** Multi-User Mode is supported on all Zebra Android devices that support Zebra MX functionality, but the AccessMgr cannot currently enable it. Enabling Multi-User Mode currently is done using unsupported tools or mechanisms that might not scale to large deployments. For this reason, the ability to use the AppMgr to manage the Protected List provides limited benefit.
