Controls whether the ZVC allows the user to view and modify the volume settings for the audio stream that is typically used for music playback. Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause no change to this audio stream's visibility. 

**Parm value input rules**: 

* String from 0&ndash;255 characters
* A value of "1" makes the stream visible; a "0" makes it invisible.
