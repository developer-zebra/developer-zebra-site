Used to specify the Upper Address Part (UAP) of the remote Bluetooth device's MAC address with which to allow the target device to pair without requiring user confirmation. The UAP is generally the first three bytes of the Bluetooth MAC address. **Once a Bluetooth device is discovered, its UAP can be seen in the Bluetooth Settings activity**. Can be combined with Silent Pairing Name and (optionally) a Class of Device to create a complete Silent Pairing Rule. 

**Input value rules**: 

* A hexadecimal string representing the first three (3) bytes of the Bluetooth MAC address. For example: "0A:1B:2C"
