This parm will allow you to turn the Save Form Data Option of the Default Android Web Browser On or Off.

Turning the Save Form Data Option On can make browsing more convenient by eliminating the need for the device user to re-enter the same information into the same form later. Turning the Save Form Data Option Off is generally more secure, especially on a device that might be shared, since it would prevent an unauthorized user viewing or re-entering sensitive information that was previously entered by an authorized user.
