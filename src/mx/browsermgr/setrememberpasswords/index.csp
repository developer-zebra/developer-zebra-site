Used to enable/disable the Remember Passwords Option for the default Android web browser. 

Enabling Remember Passwords can make browsing more convenient by eliminating the need for the device user to enter a password on subsequent visits to a web site. Disabling Remember Passwords is generally more secure, especially on a device that might be shared, since it would prevent an unauthorized user from logging in using a password that was previously entered by an authorized user.

>**Note:** This feature is available only on Jelly Bean devices; it has been depreciated on Android KitKat and higher.
