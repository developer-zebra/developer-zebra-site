Controls whether a button labeled "Take bug report" is displayed in Android's "Power-off" Menu, which appears after long-pressing the power key on the device. Bug reports generated using this feature are stored and/or sent using the handling preferences specified in [Bug Report Profile parameter](#bugreporthandling). **Note**: The "Take bug report" function also can be switched on and off and silently executed (no user Dialog) from the Settings panel. 

**Most Power-off Menu functions are controlled by the [Power Key Manager](/mx/powerkeymgr)**.
