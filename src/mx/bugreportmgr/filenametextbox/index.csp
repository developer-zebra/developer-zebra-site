Allows the user to provide a name for the bug being reported. Text entered here is appended to the file name of the bug report (following the date and time) and becomes the name of the file within the report's zip file that contains the user-entered data. Spaces entered into this field are converted to underscore characters; other non-text characters are removed. If left blank by the user, "no_user_entry" will appear.

**Parm value input rules**: 

* String of at least 1 character to provide the issue with a name
