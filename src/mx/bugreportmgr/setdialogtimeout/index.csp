Controls whether the Dialog for collecting user-generated bug report information will be dismissed automatically after 60 seconds of inactivity (the default value) or after a custom interval specified using the DialogTimeout parameter. Dialogs dismissed as a result of user inactivity will result in a bug report with "no_user_entry" appended to the file name; any data collected in Text Boxes to that point is retained.
