Controls whether the imager on the device, if so equipped, can be used to take pictures. If the device is not equipped with an imager or the ability to take pictures using the imager, use of this parm will return an error in the Result XML document.

>**Notes**:
* Limited support for picture-taking using non-camera devices may be available on devices running Android L or higher.
* Blocking the imager on Android L devices disables SimulScan.
