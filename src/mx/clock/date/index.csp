Used to manually set the Date on the device. **Date and Time values given to the Clock must be represented as UTC**. (see Overview). Specifying an empty value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will retain any previously configured Date.

**Parm input rules**: 

* Accepts a string of exactly 0 or 10 characters only
* The 10-character string must be in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD" 
* Date must be represented as a UTC value (see Overview)
