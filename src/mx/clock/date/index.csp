Used to manually set the local Date on the device. Entering an empty value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) causes the previously configured Date to remain unchanged.

**Parm input rules**: 

* Accepts a string of exactly 0 or 10 characters only
* The 10-character string must be in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD"
