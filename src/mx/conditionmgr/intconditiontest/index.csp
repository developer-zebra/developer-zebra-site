Used to select a comparator for a specified value against the tested constant value to arrive at a Boolean value. For example, to set an operation to proceed only on devices with at least half of their battery power available, set this value to 5 ("Greater-than-or-equal-to a Constant Integer") and set the Constant Integer Value to 50.
