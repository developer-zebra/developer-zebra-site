Used to specify a string against which to compare a string on the device. The specified string can be of any size (including 0), but might be limited indirectly by the MXMS framework, which imposes a restriction on the overall size of any single XML file. 

**Parm value input rules**:

* Accepts a character string of any length (including 0)
