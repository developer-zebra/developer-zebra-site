Used to enter the name of a file on the device that contains DataWedge configuration settings. 

**Input value rules**: 

* String from 0&ndash;255 characters containing name of configuration file on the device

DataWedge supports the importing of Config files (`datawedge.db`) and Profiles (`dwprofile_profilename.db`) to devices through commercially available third-party Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems. When DataWedge launches, it checks the `/enterprise/device/settings/datawedge/autoimport` directory for the presence of such files. If any are found, it executes the functions below.

**DataWedge Auto-Import routine**:

1. Import the new file(s)
2. Replace the existing Config file and like-named Profile(s) (if any)
3. Delete the imported files
4. Put new settings immediately into effect


Important Notes:
* For the best experience, **Zebra strongly recommends that users be advised to <u>exit any DataWedge configuration UI screen</u>** before new Config files are remotely deployed.
* **On devices running Android KitKat or later**, the /enterprise folder cannot be seen with File Explorer or other user-level tools. Moving configuration files to and from the /autoimport or /enterprisereset folders must be done programmatically, or with a staging client app or MDM.
* **DataWedge versions prior to 6.9** attempt to consume any of the monitored “.db” files as soon the file name(s) appear in the /autoimport folder. Therefore, **it is possible for DataWedge to attempt to consume a file before it is completely written**. To avoid this condition, **Zebra recommends initially storing the file with an alternate extension** (i.e. ".tmp") and changing the extension to .db once writing is complete.
* **Zebra recommends applying explicit file permissions to the all .db files** so that DataWedge file procedures will not be impeded.
