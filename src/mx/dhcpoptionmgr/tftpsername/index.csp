Controls whether a request for a TFTP Server Name will be sent by the DHCP Client to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request. When requested, the DHCP Server will return the TFTP Server Name to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.

A TFTP (Trivial File Transport Protocol) Server provides simple means for a remote client to get or put a file. A primary use of TFTP is configuring a device when it first joins a network. TFTP is used because it is very simple to implement but must be used with caution because it lacks security and other more advanced file transfer features.

**Important:** The DHCP Client does not automatically use an acquired TFTP Server Name to perform file transfers or configuration. To configure a device using TFTP, use DhcpOptionMgr to acquire the TFTP Server Name and provide it to the TFTP Client that will perform the file transfer. The transferred files can then be used to perform the desired configuration.
