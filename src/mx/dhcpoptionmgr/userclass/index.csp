Control whether a User Class will be sent by the DHCP Client to the DHCP Server via the User Class DHCP Option. The User Class is generally used by a DHCP Server to select the proper pool of IP Addresses from which to acquire the IP Address to assign to the device. It may also be used by the DHCP Server to determine which additional information should be returned to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.
