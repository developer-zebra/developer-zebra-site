Vendor Encapsulated, also referred to as Vendor Specific, is a DHCP option that can be requested by the DHCP Client. The value of this option is determined by the specific vendor of the DHCP server. In complex network environments where they may be multiple vendors, this option is often used with option 60 so that the correct DHCP server is used for the given device.
