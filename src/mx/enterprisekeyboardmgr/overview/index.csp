Enterprise Keyboard Manager controls the settings of Enterprise Keyboard, Zebra's soft input device that provides an efficient means of hand-inputting data into Zebra devices running Android. Building on the stock Android keyboard, Enterprise Keyboard adds programmable keys, switches quickly between languages and key layouts, and can scan data directly into an application. 

Enterprise Keyboard also makes use of Android's Personal Dictionary for spelling suggestions and corrections, and permits customers and partners to populate the device with industry-specific terms to help improve the speed and accuracy of keyboard input. A Personal Dictionary can be populated and mass-deployed through Zebra's Mobility Extensions (MX) and [StageNow](/stagenow/2-2/about/) tools. Learn more [about the Personal Dictionary](../personaldictionarymgr).

Also see the [Enterprise Keyboard User Guide](../../enterprise-keyboard/1-0/guide/about/).

#### About Tab-key Navigation
The Enterprise Keyboard Tab key is designed to move the cursor or UI focus from one text field or UI component to the next. For HTML apps, Zebra recommends using the Tab key to navigate from field to field. On apps that are unaware of this context, the Tab key might input spaces instead of moving the cursor. For help with native-app navigation, please refer to the [Android Tab-key navigation](https://developer.android.com/training/keyboard-input/navigation.html) section of the Android developer docs.
