Controls the GMS applications and services allowed to run on the device. 

**`IMPORTANT:` If GMS apps were previously disabled using the "DisableGMSApps" App Manager Action, they must be re-enabled using the "EnableGMSApps" App Manager Action <u>prior to upgrading the device to enable GMS Manager</u>**. Failure to do so can result in unpredictable behavior.<br>

**`NOTE:`** **It is NOT possible to transition a device to a new OS _<u>and</u>_ to implement GMS Restricted mode with a single XML profile**.
