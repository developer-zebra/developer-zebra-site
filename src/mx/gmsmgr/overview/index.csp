GMS Manager (GmsMgr) controls which Google Mobile Services (GMS) are available on a Zebra device, giving device administrators improved control over data privacy. A device in "GMS "Restricted" mode disables many Google primary applications and services, including: 

* Chrome 
* Gmail
* Google Play 
* Photos
* YouTube

This also renders inoperable secondary applications and services that rely on those primary services, including: 

* Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
* Google Maps 
* Location services
* SafetyNet

#### Important Notes
* Based on GMS dependencies, apps and services other than those listed above also might fail when a device is in GMS Restricted mode. 
* Apps that use FCM to deliver notifications are unable to do so using this framework when running on a GMS-restricted device. Such apps might fail or behave unpredictably. 
* When location services are disabled, the device is set to “Device Only” location mode.
* The ability to add or manage users on a device is prevented by GMS Restricted; any existing Google accounts are disabled. 

### Main Functionality

* Allow all GMS apps and services to run on the device
* Enable a fixed, minimal set of GMS apps and services to run on the device
