Used to specify the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) Proxy. Custom parameters are "pass-through" fields; they hold sets of values in various combinations for the purpose of easily switching from one APN to another to adapt to various cellular networks. The rules for these values and settings vary by region and SIM card. 

**Zebra recommends testing carrier-specified APN settings on a working device and SIM card before deployment**. 

Parm value input rules: 

* String from 0 - 255 characters
