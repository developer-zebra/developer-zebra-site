Used to specify the Android Category of the application to which the Intent will be sent. A Category and Action Name combine to form a "channel" to which an app can listen for intents that use the same combination. This has the effect of filtering out the "chatter" of other intents using different value pairs. **An app's intent Category is defined in its** `AndroidManifest.xml` **file**. 

**Parm value input rules**: 

* String containing the Category of the target app
