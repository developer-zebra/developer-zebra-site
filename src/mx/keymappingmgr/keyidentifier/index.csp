Used to identify the Key for which an Override-Key Mapping will be added or modified. To add or modify an Override Mapping for a Key, specify the **Option** (Key Identifier) listed in the table below that matches the friendly **Name** and **Description** of the Key to be mapped.

**Not all devices have Keys for every Key Identifier in the table**. Attempts to add an Override Mapping for a Key that is not present on a device will produce an error in the Result XML. For a list of supported Keys on a specific device, query the KeyMappingMgr for Key Identifiers (see Queries, below) or refer to the device documentation. For known deviations from these standards, **see the [Standards and Deviations section](#standardsanddeviations)** of the Overview at the top of this page.
