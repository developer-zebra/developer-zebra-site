Used to specify the action to perform on an Activation ID (AID) on the device. **For Zebra-branded devices only**. For Symbol-branded devices, use the License Action parameter. To use Option 6, specify the 39-character Activation ID using the Activation ID Refresh parameter. **Note: Options 4 and 5 are used programmatically on the device and are not intended for human interaction**. 

`IMPORTANT PREACTIVATED LICENSE RESTRICTIONS:`
* **Preactivated Licenses are <u>valid only on the day they are generated</u>**. 
* If multiple Preactivated Licenses are generated, they must be applied in the same order as generated.
* Preactivated Licenses must be applied BEFORE all other License Actions. 
* If combining the application of Activation IDs and Preactivated Licenses in the same configuration Profile, Preactivated Licenses MUST be applied first.
