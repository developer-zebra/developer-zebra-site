Used to specify whether a Request XML document will be made Persistent or Non-persistent, and to Enable or Disable a Persistent Request XML document. Request XML documents must be specified using a "Persist As Name" and "Persist As Version" identifiers. The optional "Persist As Order" identifier also must be used if it was previously specified. 

Request XML documents are Non-persistent by default, and must be designated as Persistent to remain on a device following an Enterprise Reset. Documents made Persistent are Enabled by default. Following a reset, the PersistMgr service reapplies the settings of all Request XML documents that are **Persistent _and_  Enabled**. Disabled Persistent documents will remain on the device following an Enterprise Reset, but their settings will not be reapplied.
