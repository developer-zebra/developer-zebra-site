Controls whether the Safe Mode control is available in the Power-off Menu on devices that support this option. Safe Mode is typically used to perform troubleshooting operations that might be impeded by certain applications or services that would normally start when booting the device normally. Since booting into Safe Mode could render the operation of the device insecure and likely would impact the ability of the device to perform its production functions, it desirable  under most circumstances to prevent device users from booting into Safe Mode.
