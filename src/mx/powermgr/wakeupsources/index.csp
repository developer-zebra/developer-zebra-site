Used to control wake-up actions, which are button- or key-presses that wake the device from suspend mode. **Supported devices by default wake only by means of the power button**. Enabling this paramater (option 1) adds the push-to-talk (PTT) button (on the left side of the device) and scan buttons as wake-up sources.
