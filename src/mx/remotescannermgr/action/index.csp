Actions initiate management functions on remote Bluetooth scanners paired with and connected to with the device. This parm does not provide functionality for the acquisition of files, as are required for applying device settings or firmware updates. Such files must be acquired separately using [FileMgr](../filemgr), StageNow, an MDM solution or by another means.
