Controls whether the device user can select the desired tags when multiple tags are within scanning range. When using this parameter, queries in a scanning session support tags flagged as S0, S1, S2 or S3. Use of this parameter can help improve scanning performance and avoid the "noise" of decoding unwanted tags.
