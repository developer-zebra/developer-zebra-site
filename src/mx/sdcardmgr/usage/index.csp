Used to control access to the Storage Card selected to support this feature on a given device. When Enabled, access to the Storage Card will be completely blocked. On devices that support a removable storage medium, that medium will be the default target of the Usage parameter of this CSP. Otherwise, the Primary Storage Card is the target. 

**Note:** Removable media can become inaccessible by means other than blockage by this CSP. For example, an unblocked Micro SD Card will be inaccessible if physically removed from the device or if encrypted and the Named Key has been removed from the Key Storage Database (see [EncryptMgr](../encryptmgr)).
