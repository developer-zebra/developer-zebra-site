Controls device-user access to the "Enterprise Reset" function of the Android Settings panel. An Enterprise Reset is intended to return the device to an enterprise-defined default state, generally as determined by the contents of the `/enterprise` partition on the device. **Note: This parameter does not perform an Enterprise data reset**.  

**An Enterprise Reset can cause data loss. For more information, see [Power Manager](../mx/powermgr/#enterprisereset)**.

>**Note:** Just because access to a Storage Card is not blocked, the Storage Card may or may not be accessible. For example, if the Storage Card is implemented by physically removable media and there is no media in the slot, then the Storage Card would not be accessible even though access to the Storage Card was enabled. Or, if the Storage Card was encrypted, and the Named Key was removed from the Key Storage Database (see the EncryptMgr), the Storage Card would not be accessible even though it was present and not blocked.
