Removes from the device all Secure Storage Keys, which would otherwise be used to access portions of the device protected by encryption. Execution of this countermeasure does not necessarily prevent access to the encrypted data, but prevents the data from being decrypted and thus exploited. Once a threat has been neutralized, Secure Storage Keys can be restored to the device to provide access to the secure storage area as normal.
