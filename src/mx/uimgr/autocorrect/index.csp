Controls whether AutoCorrect functionality is accessible on the device. AutoCorrect can be used to save commonly entered words or industry-specific words or phrases and offer them as corrections to potentially mistyped words. Such functionality could present a security risk by exposing sensitive information to subsequent device users that are not authorized to view or reuse that information. 

**Note: This parameter does not turn the AutoCorrect function on or off or configure any of its functions**. When AutoCorrect is enabled, an administrator or device user must still use the System Settings panel turn the function on or off and configure its functions. When disabled, AutoCorrect functionality cannot be used on the device.
