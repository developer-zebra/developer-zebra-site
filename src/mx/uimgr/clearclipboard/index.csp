Used to immediately clear the contents of the clipboard, preventing data that was stored there from being pasted at any time thereafter. If use of the Clipboard function is allowed by an application, it might be advisable to use this parm to clear sensitive information from clipboard upon exiting. This would ensure that such information could not later be pasted into another application.
