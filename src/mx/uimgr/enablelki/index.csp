This is the On/Off switch for the Large Key Indicator (LKI) pop-up, which is used to show active modifier keys. On most devices, the indicator is displayed in the Status Bar at the top of the screen. This parameter is accessible by the user only when SetLKI is set to "Turn On."  **LKI features are supported on MC93 devices only**.
