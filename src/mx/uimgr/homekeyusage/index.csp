---

Used to prevent use of the HOME key to exit the current app and run the Home Screen app. This might be desirable when the device is devoted to running a single application, such as that of a kiosk. By blocking use of the HOME key, a common method of navigating away from the application (whether intentional or not) can be eliminated.

**Note: Enabling this parameter does not affect the "long press" behavior of the HOME key**. To completely prevent all HOME key functionality, use the [Key Mapping Manager](../keymappingmgr) (on supported devices) to disable the HOME key or map it to a desired behavior.
