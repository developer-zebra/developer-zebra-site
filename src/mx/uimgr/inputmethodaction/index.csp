Controls whether to change the Default Input Method (i.e. a soft keyboard) when that change is requested programmatically or manually by the device user. Setting a particular Input Method as the Default Input Method does not prevent the device user from manually selecting a different Input Method, it merely determines which Input Method will come up automatically each time that parm is invoked. When changing the Current Locale, it may desirable to also change the Default Input Method to one that is suitable for entry of characters that are associated with the selected Locale.
