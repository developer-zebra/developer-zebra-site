This is the On/Off switch for the on-screen Navigation Bar, which contains the BACK, HOME and RECENT soft keys. Disabling the Navigation Bar prevents the user from quitting the currently running app by means of those keys. **This parameter applies only to the soft keys; it does not control capacitive or hardware keys, which can be disabled separately using the [Keymapping Manager](../keymappingmgr)**. 

**Also see the Recent App Button Usage parameter** elsewhere on this page.
