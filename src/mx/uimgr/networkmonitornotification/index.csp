Controls whether the message "Network may be monitored..." will be displayed on the device when the device user connects to certain types of networks. This message is generally associated with networks that implement a public key infrastructure and require a root certificate on the device before a client will be allowed to connect. 

**Security Warning**: The "Network may be monitored..." message is a safeguard intended to warn device users of a potential security risk. **Administrators should not suppress this message unless CA certificates have been properly vetted before installation on a device, and should ensure that no untrusted certificates can be subsequently installed** while the message remains suppressed.
