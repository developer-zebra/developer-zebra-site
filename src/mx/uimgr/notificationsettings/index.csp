Controls whether the "Gear" icon is displayed in the Android Notifications panel. The Gear icon provides immediate access to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and other commonly used System settings without having to go through the Settings panel. The Notifications panel is accessed from most applications by dragging downward from the Notification/Status bar at the top of the Android screen. Hiding the Gear icon can prevent a device user from accessing those Settings and changing device behavior.
