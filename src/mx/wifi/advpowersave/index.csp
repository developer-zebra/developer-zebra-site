Used to configure the Power Save Mode from the settings table below. **The default "Fast Power Save" value must be used for the "Power Save" parameter; the "Do not change" value will result in failure**.

**Important: Wi-Fi Advanced Options should be used only at the direction of Zebra Support or other qualified personnel. Altering this setting can result in undesirable behavior**.
