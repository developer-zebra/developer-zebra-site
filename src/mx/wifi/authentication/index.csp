    - code: 1

      name: EAP-TLS
      description: This indicates that the network requires authentication using the 802.1x Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) standard (RFC 5216). EAP-TLS requires a device identity to be specified and requires that a client certificate be specified to prove the authenticity of the device identity. In all EAP modes, an optional certificate may be specified to help verify the identity of the authentication server.
    - code: 13
      mx: "4.2"
      name: EAP-FAST-GTC
      description: This indicates that the network requires authentication using a token generated using a Generic Token Card (GTC) within an anonymous TLS tunnel established using the 802.1x Extensible Authentication Protocol - Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) standard (RFC 5422). EAP-FAST-GTC requires a device identity to be specified and requires that a token value (typically obtained from a physical token device) be specified to prove the authenticity of that device identity. An optional client certificate may also be specified to verify the authenticity of the device identity. In all EAP modes, an optional certificate may be specified to help verify the identity of the authentication server.
    - code: 11
      mx: "4.2"
      name: WPA/WPA2
      description: This indicates that the network requires authentication using the Microsoft Challenge Authentication Protocol Version 2 (MSCHAPV2) within an anonymous TLS tunnel established using the 802.1x Extensible Authentication Protocol - Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) standard (RFC 5422). EAP-FAST-MSCHAPV2 requires a device identity to be specified and requires that a password be specified to prove the authenticity of that device identity. An optional client certificate may also be specified to verify the authenticity of the device identity. In all EAP modes, an optional certificate may be specified to help verify the identity of the authentication server.
    - code: 8
      mx: "4.2"
      name: EAP-TTLS-PAP
      description: This indicates that the network requires authentication using the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) within a secure TLS tunnel established using the 802.1x Extensible Authentication Protocol - Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) standard (RFC 5281). EAP-TTLS-PAP requires a device identity to be specified and requires that a password be specified to prove the authenticity of that device identity. An optional client certificate may also be specified to verify the authenticity of the device identity. In all EAP modes, an optional certificate may be specified to help verify the identity of the authentication server.
    - code: 6
      mx: "4.2"
      name: EAP-TTLS-MSCHAP
      description: This indicates that the network requires authentication using the Microsoft Challenge Authentication Protocol (MSCHAP) within a secure TLS tunnel established using the 802.1x Extensible Authentication Protocol - Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) standard (RFC 5281). EAP-TTLS-MSCHAP requires a device identity to be specified and requires that a password be specified to prove the authenticity of that device identity. An optional client certificate may also be specified to verify the authenticity of the device identity. In all EAP modes, an optional certificate may be specified to help verify the identity of the authentication server.

      name: EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPV2
      description: This indicates that the network requires authentication using the Microsoft Challenge Authentication Protocol Version 2 (MSCHAPV2) within a secure TLS tunnel established using the 802.1x Extensible Authentication Protocol - Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) standard (RFC 5281). EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPV2 requires a device identity to be specified and requires that a password be specified to prove the authenticity of that device identity. An optional client certificate may also be specified to verify the authenticity of the device identity. In all EAP modes, an optional certificate may be specified to help verify the identity of the authentication server.
    - code: 4
      mx: "4.2"
      name: LEAP
      description: This indicates that the network requires authentication using the Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) defined by Cisco. LEAP uses a modified version of MSCHAP without a secure tunnel and hence can be easily compromised. LEAP requires a device identity to be specified and requires that a password be specified to prove the authenticity of that device identity. Unlike standard EAP modes, LEAP does not support an optional certificate to help verify the identity of the authentication server.
    - code: 2
      mx: "4.2"
      name: PEAP-MSCHAPV2
      description: This indicates that the network requires authentication using the Microsoft Challenge Authentication Protocol Version 2 (MSCHAPV2) within a secure TLS tunnel established using the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, (PEAP) defined by Cisco Systems, Microsoft, and RSA Security. PEAP-MSCHAPV2 requires a device identity to be specified and requires that a password be specified to prove the authenticity of that device identity. An optional client certificate may also be specified to verify the authenticity of the device identity. In all EAP modes, an optional certificate may be specified to help verify the identity of the authentication server.
    - code: 10
      mx: "4.2"
      name: PEAP-GTC
      description: This indicates that the network requires authentication using a token generated using a Generic Token Card (GTC) within a secure TLS tunnel established using the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, (PEAP) defined by Cisco Systems, Microsoft, and RSA Security. PEAP-GTC requires a device identity to be specified and requires that a token value (typically obtained from a physical token device) be specified to prove the authenticity of that device identity. An optional client certificate may also be specified to verify the authenticity of the device identity. In all EAP modes, an optional certificate may be specified to help verify the identity of the authentication server.

Used to specify the Authentication Mode used by the network. When a Security Mode of "Enterprise" is selected, an Authentication Mode must be specified to determine how authentication will be performed as part of the 802.1x EAP type used by the network.
