This is the On/Off switch for Call Admission Control, which can help prevent voice-traffic congestion and improve call quality. **Enabled by default**. When in use, the Wi-Fi stack negotiates to reserve bandwidth using Traffic Specification (TSPEC), the IEEE 802.11e standard for Quality of Service-capable networks on which Call Admission Control is mandated.
