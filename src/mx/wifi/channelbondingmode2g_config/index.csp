This is the On/Off switch for 2g Channel Bonding, which controls whether use of the 40MHz-wide channel in the 2.4GHz band is allowed. This can be useful for configuring devices to operate properly on networks that do not support this capability and to improve device performance on networks that do.  

**Important: Attempts to use this parameter on a device that doesn't support it returns a value of "99" in the relevant section of the Result XML file**.
