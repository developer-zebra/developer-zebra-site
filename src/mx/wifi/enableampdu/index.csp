This is the On/Off switch for use of the Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit (AMPDU), which can improve performance and optimize data transmission by grouping multiple MPDU blocks together. 

**Important: Attempts to use this parameter on a device that doesn't support it returns a value of "0" or "99" (depending on the MX version) in the relevant section of the Result XML file**.
