Used to specify the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) encryption type to enforce on the network for Wi-Fi log-ins. The values that can be selected for Encryption Type will vary based on the selections made for Security Mode and WPA Mode. A selection must always be made for Encryption Type whenever Security Mode is not "Open" (no encryption).
