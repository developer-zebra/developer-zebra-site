This is the On/Off switch for Gratuitous ARP, an address resolution protocol that uses a modified request packet to help identify IP address conflicts and other issues. 

**Important: Attempts to use this parameter on a device that doesn't support it returns a value of "99" in the relevant section of the Result XML file**.
