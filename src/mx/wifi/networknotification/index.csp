Controls whether to present user notifications when unknown, open networks such as those offered by public Wi-Fi come into range of the device. If enabled, the user will be presented with the opportunity to connect with such networks. This might be desireable for personal or dual-use devices, but could introduce vulnerabilities when connecting to non-secure or otherwise unknown networks. **Zebra recommends disabling Network Notification on devices intended for use only on corporate Wi-Fi networks**.
