Controls whether the Wi-Fi Password stored on the device is encrypted, thereby preventing access to the clear-text Password on the device by any application or malicious exploit. 

>**Note**: Enabling this feature **prevents the Google Mobile Service (GMS) backup service from successfully restoring Wi-Fi settings to a device**, and might effect the operation other device backup systems.

The Password combines with an Identity to form an authentication credential for gaining access to a network. Authentication is required only when "Enterprise" is the selected Security Mode. All authentication types require a Password except EAP-TLS, which uses a client certificate.
