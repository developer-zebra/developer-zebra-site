Controls use of a proxy, an intermediary service that routes HTTP traffic between clients on a device and another network (typically the internet or an intranet). When used, proxy settings can be configured manually can be contained in a PAC file for automatic configuration. When there is a proxy between the Wi-Fi network and some outer network, HTTP-based applications might need to negotiate with the proxy to access the services of the outer network.

**In MX 5.0 and higher, the data type for this parameter changed from a boolean (1=true; 0=false) to a value selected from the UseProxy list below**.
