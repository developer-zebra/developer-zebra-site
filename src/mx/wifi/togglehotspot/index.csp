Controls whether the device user is permitted to change the state (active/inactive) of the hotspot on the device. When Enabled, the device can be used as an internet access point for nearby devices, sharing its Wi-Fi or cellular internet connection. When Disabled, the device user can view the state but cannot change it. **Hotspot functionality is supported only on certain Zebra devices, including the ET50, ET55 and TC56 devices running Android 5.0 Lollipop and higher**. 

> **Note**: This parameter does not control activation of the hotspot feature on the device.
