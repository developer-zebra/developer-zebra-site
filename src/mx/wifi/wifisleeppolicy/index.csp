Specifies the state of the Wi-Fi radio when the device enters sleep mode. When Wi-Fi remains enabled during sleep, existing Wi-Fi connections is maintained as during normal operations. While preferrable for some situations, **this mode can significantly reduce battery life**.

Android devices by default enter sleep mode after being idle for a specified period of time. While in this mode, apps run in a lower-power state. 

<!-- see BSPA-87525
info: This parameter cannot be configured in devices running Android 8.x and higher; the Wi-Fi radio is locked into the "AlwaysOn" setting.
