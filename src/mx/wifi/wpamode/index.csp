      name: WPA
      description: This indicates that the network requires encryption using the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) standard. WPA only performs encryption using the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol. A TKIP-compatible key will therefore need to be specified.
    - code: 2
      mx: "4.2"
      name: WPA2
      description: This indicates that the network requires encryption using the Wi-Fi Protected Access version 2 (WPA2) standard. WPA2 supports encryption using either the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for backward compatibility with WPA, or the more secure Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. A decision about whether to use TKIP or AES (or auto-select) will need to be made and then a TKIP or AES-compatible key will need to be specified.
    - code: 3
      mx: "4.2"
      name: WPA/WPA2
      description: This indicates that the network supports both the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) standard and the Wi-Fi Protected Access version 2 (WPA2) standard. This is essentially the same effect as selecting WPA2 since WPA2 supports backward compatibility with WPA.
    - code: 4
      mx: "4.2"
      name: WEP
      description: This indicates that the network requires encryption using the older, and less secure, Wired Equivalency Privacy (WEP) standard. A decision about the WEP key size to use will need to be made and then a WEP key of the selected size will need to be specified.

When the selected Security Mode is "Personal" or "Enterprise", the WPA Mode must be specified to determine what sort of key will then be used.

> **Note:** WEP is not supported with a Enterprise Security Mode. It is only supported using Personal Security Mode.
