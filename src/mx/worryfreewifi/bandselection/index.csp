Used to specify which RF band(s) the device will use for 802.11 communications. This parameter is usually set automatically through negotiation with the Wi-Fi infrastructure. However, it might sometimes be desirable to limit Wi-Fi communications to certain bands, leaving other bands free for other purposes.
