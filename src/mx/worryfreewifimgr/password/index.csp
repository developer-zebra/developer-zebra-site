Used to enter the password for access by the device user to WorryFree Wi-Fi configuration settings. 

**`IMPORTANT NOTE:` If a barcode is created with [Zebra StageNow](/stagenow) using MX 10.2 or older**, a password with fewer than eight (8) characters is permitted. However, an **"invalid password" error results** if that barcode is scanned with a device containing a `com.symbol.mxmf.csp.worryfreewifimgr` CSP version greater than 9.3.1. **To display the version of any CSP on a device, enable "Show System" in Settings -> Apps**.

**Parm value input rules**: 

* **MX 10.3 and later**: String from 8&ndash;32 containing valid password characters 
* **MX 10.2 and earlier**: String from 1&ndash;32 containing valid password characters
