## Overview

**OEMinfo defines Data Consumers as apps seeking to retrieve information about the device on which they are running**. Examples of such Zebra-owned apps include StageNow and OEMconfig device configuration tools, as well as Power Manager and other built-in configuration service provider (CSP) modules, which interface directly with Zebra's device-API layer.

<br>

Information for consumption is made available through **[Data Provider apps](../publish)**. Both app types&ndash;Consumers and Providers&ndash;use the [Zebra Data Provider Interfaces (ZDPIs)](../faq/#whatdoeszdpistandfor) included in the [OEMinfo Content Provider Framework](../faq/#oeminfocontentproviderframework) to consume data and to publish data for consumption. 

-----

## Consuming OEMinfo Data

**The process of retrieving data through OEMinfo is the same as that of querying an [Android content provider](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers)**. And like Android, OEMinfo employs content URIs to identify certain data available from a provider. Each content URI includes the authority of the Content Provider represented as a symbolic name along with a path to a table. When calling a client method to access a Content Provider's table, the content URI for the table is passed as an argument.

**However, before an app can retrieve data from OEMinfo, it must first receive permission** to do so. This step must be performed only once for each app, but is required before the app can attempt any OEMinfo read operation. 

**URIs are broken into three parts**: “Authority," “Package Name” and “API" as follows: 

    :::xml
    content://<Authority>/<Provider>/<API>

     // For example: 
     content://oem_info/oem.zebra.secure/build_serial

* **Authority**: `oem_info` is the content provider authority name
* **Provider**: `oem.zebra.secure` is the unique name within the given authority
* **API**: `build_serial` is the API name within the given package name

#### To acquire read permission: 

**Add the following statement to the app's** `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

        <uses-permission android:name=”com.zebra.provider.READ”>

-----

### Authorization Mechanism

The ZDPI uses Zebra [Access Manager](/mx/accessmgr) to grant or deny apps authorization to access data published by the framework. The Zebra-owned system components and application types listed below are authorized by default. 

#### Pre-Authorized Apps
* Zebra built-in system apps (e.g. OEMConfig, StageNow, MX components (CSPs))
* Apps signed with the Zebra Common Key
* Dual-key apps if one of the keys is the Zebra Common Key
* Plug-in CSPs (installed after shipment from factory and authorized by key generated by Zebra CA)

**Note**: All such apps have package names that begin with “com.zebra”

#### Authorization Required
* Customer-developed apps and services
* Third-party apps
* Any app NOT developed by Zebra

When provisioning one or more of the app types listed above, authorization to access the ZDPI can be granted using StageNow and Access Manager, OEMconfig and the Service Access Configuration, or a company's own Enterprise Mobile Management system.

#### To grant access using Access Manager and StageNow:

Configure the following actions based on the individual requirements. 

1. **Service Access Action**: “Allow Caller to Call Service”
2. **Service Identifier**: ZDPI URI to access (see [Data Consumption guide](../consume))
3. **Caller Package Name**: Package Name of the third-party app
4. **Caller Signature**: App certificate of the third-party app

**[How to generate a caller signature](https://developer.zebra.com/blog/generating-package-signature-use-mx)** | Also known as a package signature

### Acquire Serial Number 

1. **Get the AUTHORITY, PROVIDER and API** using the following command:<br>

        String SERIAL_URI** = `content://oem_info/oem.zebra.secure/build_serial`
2. **Get the data** (in this case the device serial number) by parsing the string using Android cursor query methods implemented in the following Java code:<br>

        :::java
        // Prepare the URI
        public void getData() {
            final Uri myUri = Uri.parse(SERIAL_URI);
            new UpdateAsync().execute(myUri.toString());
        }

        // Always query for data in Async task or background thread
        class UpdateAsync extends AsyncTask<String,Void,Cursor> {
            private String myUri;

        @Override
        protected Cursor doInBackground(String... args) {
            myUri = args[0];

            // Query the content provider
            ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
            Cursor cursor = cr.query(Uri.parse(myUri),
                                null, null, null, null);

            // Read the cursor
            cursor.moveToFirst();
            String serialNumber = cursor.getString(0);
            Log.i(TAG, "Device Serial Number is : ” + serialNumber);            
            return cursor;
        }
        }

**The next two sections apply the above process for getting the device IMEI and OS update info**. 

**Skip the the [Callback section](#callbacks)** to see sample code for setting an app to be notified of changes to OEMinfo data. This Zebra-recommended practice can be helpful for monitoring non-static URIs.

### Acquire IMEI

4. **Get the AUTHORITY, PROVIDER and API** using the following command:<br>

        String IMEI_URI = “content://oem_info/wan/imei”
5. **Get the data** (in this case the device IMEI number) by parsing the string using Android cursor query methods implemented in the following Java code:<br>

        :::java
        // Prepare the URI
        public void getData() {
            final Uri myUri = Uri.parse(IMEI_URI);
            new UpdateAsync().execute(myUri.toString());
        }

        // Always query for data in Async task or background thread
        class UpdateAsync extends AsyncTask<String,Void,Cursor> {
            private String myUri;

        @Override
        protected Cursor doInBackground(String... args) {
            myUri = args[0];

        // Query the content provider
        ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
        Cursor cursor = cr.query(Uri.parse(myUri),
                            null, null, null, null);

        // Read the cursor
        cursor.moveToFirst();
        String imeiNumber = cursor.getString(0);
        Log.i(TAG, "Device IMEI is : ” + imeiNumber);            
        return cursor;
        }
        }

-----

### Acquire OS update info

6. **Get the AUTHORITY, PROVIDER and API** using the following Java code:<br>

        :::java
        // OS UPDATE URI
        String OSU_URI = “content://oem_info/oem.zebra.osupdate”;

        // APIs
        String OSU_STATUS = “status”;
        String OSU_DETAIL = “detail”;
        String OSU_TS = “ts”;

7. **Get the data** (in this case the device OS update info) by parsing the string using Android cursor query methods implemented in the following Java code:<br>

            :::java
            // Prepare the URI
            public void getData() {
                final Uri myUri = Uri.parse(OSU_URI);
                new UpdateAsync().execute(myUri.toString());
            }

            // Always query for data in Async task or background thread
            class UpdateAsync extends AsyncTask<String,Void,Cursor> {
                private String myUri;

            @Override
            protected Cursor doInBackground(String... args) {
                myUri = args[0];

                // Query the content provider
                ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
                Cursor cursor = cr.query(Uri.parse(myUri),
                                    null, null, null, null);

                // Read the cursor
                While (cursor.moveToNext()) {
                    String status = cursor.getString(
                                    cursor.getColumnIndex(OSU_STATUS));
                 
                    String detail = cursor.getString(
                                    cursor.getColumnIndex(OSU_DETAIL));

                    String time = cursor.getString(
                                    cursor.getColumnIndex(OSU_TS));

                    Log.i(TAG, "STATUS : " + status + “, DETAIL : ” + detail
                               + “, TIME : ” + time);            
                            }
                            return cursor;
                        }
                    }

-----

### Callbacks

**Use the following Java code to register an app to be notified when URI data changes**. Apps also can receive callbacks for changes to the content using the standard Android content observer methods, but **Zebra recommends always registering callbacks for semi-static URI values**.

    // Prepare the URI
    Uri myUri = Uri.Parse(MY_URI_STRING);

    // Register with content observer
    ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
    cr.registerContentObserver(myUri, true, 
        new ContentObserver(new Handler(getMainLooper())) {

        @Override
        public void onChange(boolean selfChange, Uri uri) {
            super.onChange(selfChange, uri);

            // Content has changed
            Log.d(TAG, "content has changed, uri = " + uri);
            // Reading the data is like above example
            getData();
        }
    });

-----

### Limitations

**Data acquired through the OEMinfo Content Provider is subject to the rules and limitations listed below**. 

* With the exception of OS Update events, **OEMinfo does NOT support reading of system properties that can change at runtime**.
* **OEMinfo reads system properties only after being signaled by the** `BOOT_COMPLETE` event.
 * After receiving `BOOT_COMPLETE`, OEMinfo queries selected system properties and refreshes the Content Provider. This generally takes a few seconds, but **a delay of about one minute is typical before results of an OS Update are published to the ZDPI**.
 * If an app queries OEMinfo too soon after reboot, **some URIs might return "stale" data**, posing a potential issue for non-static values. 
* **OEMinfo requires extra time populate the Content Provider database** when device data is wiped after an Enterprise Reset, Factory Reset or other erasure event.
  * **Zebra recommends registering apps with a content observer on the URI to receive a callback whenever new data is available** to avoid issues relating to stale or missing data due to re-population delays.
* **OEMinfo is “System UID” and platform-signed**, and is therefore **subject to platform permissions and SELinux restrictions** across Android versions and devices.
 * The same set of **system properties might not be readable on all devices**.
 * System properties might become restricted, removed or added after an OS update.
