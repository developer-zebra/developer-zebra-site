## Overview

### `UNDeR CoNSTrUCTIOn`


###`FIXXXXXXXXXXX` all below

The Zebra Data Provider Inferface (ZDPI) is a mechanism through which device data is published and consumed using OEMinfo. It is based on the [Android content provider framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers), a public specification that allows sets of device data to be made available to apps using queries similar to those of a database. 

A Zebra-branded Publisher app can insert data into this central repository for Consumer apps to retrieve. Publishers and Consumers follow the content-provider client model to insert (put) and retrieve (get) data.

Together, OEMinfo Content Provider, Publisher and Consumer offer a reliable model to handle sharing of OEM-specific, proprietary or open information on Zebra devices.
OEM Info Content Provider will be managing access to central data repository using a standard authority, for example: oem_info
 
### OEMinfo Architecture
The diagram below illustrates the high-level design of the Zebra OEM Info Content Provider framework with data provider (OEMinfo) and data consumers (Zebra apps, third-party apps).

* **OEMinfo is the data provider**
* **ZDPI service publishes data** through Zebra data publisher apps to data consumer apps 
* Zebra Access Manager grants/denies permission to consumer aoos for data access
* Zebra-owned apps include Power Manager, StageNow, FOTA, Device Tracker
* **Provider framework is extensible** without impacting consumer apps written for earlier versions.

### Authorization Mechanism

The ZDPI uses Zebra [Access Manager](/mx/accessmgr) to grant or deny apps authorization to access data published by the framework. The Zebra-owned system components and application types listed below are authorized by default. 

#### Pre-Authorized Apps
* Zebra built-in system apps (e.g. OEMConfig, StageNow, MX components (CSPs))
* Apps signed with the Zebra Common Key
* Dual-key apps if one of the keys is the Zebra Common Key
* Plug-in CSPs (installed after shipment from factory and authorized by key generated by Zebra CA)

**Note**: All such apps have package names that begin with “com.zebra”

#### Authorization Required
* Customer-developed apps and services
* Third-party apps
* Any app NOT developed by Zebra

When provisioning one or more of the app types listed above, authorization to access the ZDPI can be granted using StageNow and Access Manager, OEMconfig and the Service Access Configuration, or a company's own Enterprise Mobile Management system. 

#### To grant access using Access Manager and StageNow:
Configure the following actions based on the local environmental settings. 

1. **Service Access Action**: “Allow Caller to Call Service”
2. **Service Identifier**: ZDPI URI to access (see [Data Consumption guide](../consume))
3. **Caller Package Name**: Package Name of the third-party app
4. **Caller Signature**: App certificate of the third-party app

## DATA ZDPI URIs (put on its own page?) 

3.1 Generic Content Provider Schema

A schema URI schema has 3 parts “Authority”, “Package Name” and “API”.
content://<Authority>/<Provider>/<API>

• Authority: Content provider authority name

• Provider : A unique name in the given authority. (eg. DeviceInfo, Battery)

• API: Api name in the given package name (eg. model,manufcaturer)

• For Example, to get the device serial the content URI would be

content://oem_info/oem.zebra.secure/build_serial

3.2 Device Serial Number URI

• URI : "content://oem_info/oem.zebra.secure/build_serial"

3.3 IMEI Number URI (Android 10 only)

• URI : “content://oem_info/wan/imei”

3.4 OS Update URI

• URI : “content://oem_info/oem.zebra.osupdate/”

• API :

 o “status” - Returns SUCCESS, IN_PROGRESS, FAIL, WAITING_FOR_REBOOT, etc.

 o “detail” - Text representation of the status, contains detailed reason.

 o “ts” - Epoch time when the intent is received

3.5 Other URI
Please reach out to ZDS Team for any other URIs. Refer Appendix-1
