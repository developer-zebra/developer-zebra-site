## Overview

The Zebra Data Provider Interface (ZDPI) is a mechanism through which device data is published and consumed by other apps. ZDPI is based on the [Android content provider framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers), a public specification that allows sets of device data to be made available to apps using queries similar to those of a database. 

Content Provider apps can insert data into this central repository for Data Consumer apps to retrieve. Publishers and Consumers follow the content-provider client model to insert (put) and retrieve (get) data. Together, the OEMinfo Content Provider and Publisher and Consumers apps offer a reliable model to handle sharing of OEM-specific, proprietary, non-proprietary static and semi-static data on Zebra devices. The OEMinfo Content Provider manages access to the central repository using a standard authority.

### OEMinfo Architecture
The diagram below illustrates the high-level design of the Zebra OEM Info Content Provider framework with data provider (OEMinfo) and data consumers (Zebra apps, third-party apps).

* **OEMinfo is the data provider**
* **ZDPI service publishes data** through Zebra data publisher apps to data consumer apps 
* Zebra Access Manager grants/denies permission to consumer aoos for data access
* Zebra-owned apps include Power Manager, StageNow, FOTA, Device Tracker
* **Provider framework is extensible** without impacting consumer apps written for earlier versions.

### Authorization Mechanism

The ZDPI uses Zebra [Access Manager](/mx/accessmgr) to grant or deny apps authorization to access data published by the framework. The Zebra-owned system components and application types listed below are authorized by default. 

#### Pre-Authorized Apps
* Zebra built-in system apps (e.g. OEMConfig, StageNow, MX components (CSPs))
* Apps signed with the Zebra Common Key
* Dual-key apps if one of the keys is the Zebra Common Key
* Plug-in CSPs (installed after shipment from factory and authorized by key generated by Zebra CA)

**Note**: All such apps have package names that begin with “com.zebra”

#### Authorization Required
* Customer-developed apps and services
* Third-party apps
* Any app NOT developed by Zebra

When provisioning one or more of the app types listed above, authorization to access the ZDPI can be granted using StageNow and Access Manager, OEMconfig and the Service Access Configuration, or a company's own Enterprise Mobile Management system. 

#### To grant access using Access Manager and StageNow:
Configure the following actions based on the local environmental settings. 

1. **Service Access Action**: “Allow Caller to Call Service”
2. **Service Identifier**: ZDPI URI to access (see [Data Consumption guide](../consume))
3. **Caller Package Name**: Package Name of the third-party app
4. **Caller Signature**: App certificate of the third-party app
