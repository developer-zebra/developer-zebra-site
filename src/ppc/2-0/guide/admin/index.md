## Overview
This section discusses the use of Admin View in PowerPrecision Console (PPC), providing a centralized view for the administrator to monitor battery inventory.

## Using the Console

PowerPrecision Console server is a centralized dashboard displaying an inventory of deployed Zebra device batteries with color-coded health indicators based on state-of-health (SOH). It tracks SOH, state-of-charge (SOC), tags, battery part number, battery serial number, battery manufacture date, device model, device serial number, device IP address, last known status, and last update (elapsed time since the last update was received).

The PPC Client sends regular battery updates to the PPC Server, which automatically categorizes the batteries into “good” (green), “nearing end-of-life” (amber) and “end-of-life” (red) SOH categories based on the thresholds defined. The SOH status bar at the top right shows a quick snapshot of battery SOH for all deployed batteries with the total count of the battery in each SOH category (green, amber, red). The black icon with the hazard sign to the right of the SOH categories designate the number of batteries that have been decommissioned. The remaining two icons designate the number of devices that have the Zebra Data Services disabled and the number of devices that do not support SOH (PowerPrecision batteries). SOH filtering is available to quickly view individual or multiple SOH categories of deployed batteries to identify the batteries that are nearing EOL or need to be decommissioned. 

The columns on the dashboard can be sorted by tapping the double triangle to the right of the column name. A tabbed menu is displayed at the top of the dashboard providing access to other views: Active, Decommissioned, Add Battery, Server Settings, and Client Settings. Further customize the dashboard by selecting the categories to filter in the view.

##Search
A search can be conducted based on battery or device information. After entering in the text to search in the search field, tap on the magnifying glass to the right of the text field and select the search category: part number, battery serial number, manufacturing date, device model, device serial number, IP address, status. A search can be conducted in the **Active** tab or **Decommissioned** tab.

##Organize Batteries
Battery tags provide the capability to identify and group batteries for organizational purposes based on a common tag name.  This name can be any desired form of identification such as location, department or job function.
