## Overview

PowerPrecision Console (PPC) is a battery management solution that provides administrators a centralized view of statistical battery data from Zebra mobile device batteries, including battery health and charge level, to maximize workforce productivity. It continuously monitors battery health data analyzed in real time, giving administrators insight to determine when battery health could affect productivity as it reaches its EOL (end-of-life) and when the battery should be removed from service. Customized notifications can be triggered to alert device users of actions needed for battery swapping or decommissioning, ensuring optimized deployment of healthy batteries at all times. The centralized view of battery health is grouped into color-coded categories of "good health", "nearing EOL" and "in EOL", to identify and remove aging batteries from the battery pool prior to impacting workforce productivity.

##Main Features
PowerPrecision Console main features:

- Centralized dashboard to easily view battery information tracking: state-of-health (SOH), state-of-charge (SOC), battery status, and other information from deployed Zebra mobile computer batteries
  - Color-coded battery health indicator for SOH categories: green for good, amber for nearing end-of-life (EOL), and red for EOL
  - Historical trend of battery health
  - Filter and sort data
- Admin actions on batteries to segregate and decommission nearing EOL or EOL batteries
- Customizable EOL message notifying end-users to prepare to decommission their poor health battery
- Customizable snooze options to give end-users an opportunity to complete a task before taking action to decommission the battery
- HTTPS support for secure connections
- Battery tagging for easier organization and identification
- Report generation to export data collected
- Capability for device staging with the use of an EMM such as Zebra's [StageNow](/stagenow/latest/about) with [Battery Manager CSP](/mx/batterymgr).

##How it works

The PPC client software registers the device with the on-premise PPC server and reports battery information based on preset configurations such as frequency of reporting and event triggers including new battery inserted, battery low and device power-off. The state of battery health is monitored continuously, with multiple electrical and historical characteristics used to determine each batteryâ€™s health relative to a new battery. As battery life diminishes over time, custom messages can be triggered based on pre-determined thresholds to notify users of required actions.

## New in PPC 2.3.1

- Extended [EOL Alert](../config) options on the portal to include the ability to set an expiration time following a battery EOL, after which no further snooze options are allowed and users are prevented from using batteries that have reached EOL.
- Self-signed certificates are now supported to help simplify deployment of product demos and trials.

## Recent Version History

## Important Notes

Important notes for consideration during PPC use:

- **For Android Oreo devices or higher, when the device is rebooted after the PPC app is force stopped, the user must manually launch PPC.** If the user force stops PPC (through Android Settings > Apps & notifications > PowerPrecision Console > Force Stop) then reboots the device, PPC does not automatically restart on startup, requiring the user to manually launch PPC. This is due to an Android restriction that considers the app in a stopped state and thus requires the app to be launched manually even after reboot.
