### Remote Management
Enterprise Keyboard can be managed programmatically through [EMDK for Android](../../../../emdk-for-android) development tools or remotely using [StageNow](../../../../) and the [UI Manager](/mx/uimgr/) service (requires MX 6.3 or higher) or a company's own enterprise mobile management (EMM) system (if supported by that system). 

See the [Enterprise Keyboard Manager guide](../../../../mx/enterprisekeyboardmgr) for details.
