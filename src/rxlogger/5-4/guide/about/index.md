## Overview

RxLogger is a software tool included with every Zebra device that provides metrics for application and system diagnostics. The tool implements a GUI interface that controls `diag_daemon`, the Linux-based logging service built into Android. Diag_daemon does the real work of collecting data and logs from around the system, storing them in a single location where they are parsed, filtered and displayed by RxLogger. 

Diag_daemon uses a modular system to collect log data from logcat, the kernel and other system components. RxLogger can start and stop diag_daemon, can change the type and frequency of data collection and control how much data is stored.

## Screens and States

The startup screen of RxLogger contains four simple buttons that change in appearance depending on its state. The app's title bar also displays the state, and its version number appears in the lower-right corner.
