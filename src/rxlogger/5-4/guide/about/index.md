## Overview

RxLogger is a software tool included with every Zebra device that provides metrics for application and system diagnostics. The tool implements a GUI interface that controls `diag_daemon`, the Linux-based logging service built into Android. Diag_daemon does the real work of collecting data and logs from around the system, storing them in a single location where they are parsed, filtered and displayed by RxLogger. 

Diag_daemon uses a modular system to collect log data from logcat, the kernel and other system components. RxLogger can start and stop diag_daemon, can change the type and frequency of data collection and control how much data is stored.
