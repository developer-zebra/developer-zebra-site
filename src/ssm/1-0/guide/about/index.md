## Overview

Secure Storage Manager (SSM) is an application built into Zebra devices running Android 11 (and later) that implements Android Content Provider interfaces as a mechanism for securely sharing data from one app to another. The target and destination apps can be two distinct apps or the same app.

This guide explains how to configure a client application to share hard-coded or variable data with another app securely using SSM. 

For more information, please refer to the [Android Content Provider](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers) specification.
