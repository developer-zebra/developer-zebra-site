### II. Deploy Certificate to Device(s)

1. From the Home screen, **click the Create new Profile button**: 
  <img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="SN4_deploy01.png"/>
  _Click image to enlarge; ESC to exit_.<br>
<br>


> `IMPORTANT:` All devices that scan barcodes generated this way become "Trusted Devices" and can no longer be staged with standard "untrusted" staging Profiles; <u>they can be staged ONLY with Trusted Profiles created using the same certificate as was deployed to the device(s)</u>.

### III. Create Trusted Staging Profile

**Trusted Profiles are the same as standard ("untrusted") Profiles <u>with one important exception</u>**: The final step adds a "Trusted" designation and requires selection of a security certificate. 

#### To Create a Trusted Profile:

1. From the Home screen, **click the "Create new Profile" button**. Before selecting a Wizard, **be sure that MX 9.2 (or higher) is selected from the drop-down menu**: 
  <img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="SN4_trustedProfile00.png"/>
  _Click image to enlarge; ESC to exit_.<br>
<br>


**Trusted Profiles are identified in Profile lists by a green lock icon** as in the sample image below: 
  <img alt="image" style="height:450px" src="SN4_trustedProfile04.png"/>
  _Click image to enlarge; ESC to exit_.<br>
<br>

#### `IMPORTANT:` Trusted Devices can be staged ONLY with a Trusted Profile that contains the same certificate as was deployed to those devices. 

#### See the [Staging Profiles Guide](../stagingprofiles) for further details.
