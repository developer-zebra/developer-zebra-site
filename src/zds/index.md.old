    text: The Zebra Data Service (ZDS) is a continuous background service running on all supported Zebra devices and is responsible for collecting and uploading analytics data coming from ZDS plug-ins and Zebra-authorized third-party apps. Data is uploaded to the Zebra analytics database every 24 hours by default with transport secured with HTTPS. ZDS updates itself and the ZDS Plugin, and can accept configuration changes such as upload interval (5-minute min.) and data-collection events using a barcode scanned by the device.
