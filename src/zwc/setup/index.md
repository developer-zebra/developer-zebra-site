## Overview

### Requirements

Zebra device running Android 11 (or later)
MX 10.5 (?) or later
ZWC app 
BSP Wave 2
install ZWC (launcher) app


At the heart of the ZWC solution is the Zebra Workstation Connect app, which runs automatically whenever a device containing the app is placed in the ZWC dock. The app implements a special Android launcher that handles all communications through the dock, presents the preferred desktop on the external monitor, and stores the display mode, app shortcuts and other user preferences.   

Upon first installation, the device is forced into landscape mode and its content is mirrored on the external monitor by default.
